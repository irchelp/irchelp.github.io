# Cross-platform IRC clients
There are a large and growing number of cross-platform clients that run equally well on many different operating systems.

## Halloy

[Halloy](/clients/cross/halloy/) 
is an open-source graphical IRC client written in Rust. It aims to provide a
simple and fast client for Mac, Windows, and Linux platforms.

## HexChat
The popular XChat fork, [HexChat](./hexchat.html), originated as an unofficial Windows port, and now runs on Linux/Unix systems as well. A OSX port is available through Homebrew.

Final Release:
2.16.2 - 09 Feb 2024

## jIRCii

[jIRCii](/clients/cross/jircii.html) is a barely graphical standalone Java
client, with a look and feel inspired by [ircII](/clients/unix/ircii/) but taking advantage of
modern GUI functionality.

# Web Based Clients

Webchat interfaces are listed [elsewhere](/clients/webclients.html),
and are available anywhere there's a working web browser.

## Linux/Unix Clients on Windows

Many of the terminal-based Unix/Linux IRC clients have been ported to run on
Windows with the aid of WSL, Cygwin or MSYS. These ported clients may be awkward to use
if not comfortable with console-mode applications, and primarily cater to
advanced users.

* irssi

The popular X11 client, xchat, also has a Windows version, which is a common
alternative to mIRC on Windows systems.

## Windows Clients on Linux/Unix/OSX

mIRC is known to [work well with Wine](http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=77).
