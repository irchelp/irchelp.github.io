# Cross-platform IRC clients
There are a large and growing number of cross-platform clients that run equally well on many different operating systems.

## Halloy

[Halloy](/clients/cross/halloy.html) is an open-source graphical IRC client written in Rust. It aims to provide a simple and fast client for Mac, Windows, and Linux platforms.

## ChatZilla

[ChatZilla](/clients/cross/chatzilla.html) runs as an addon for
Firefox and Seamonkey, or standalone with the help of XULRunner, and as such
is portable to all platforms on which Firefox can run.

## LeafChat

[LeafChat](/clients/cross/leafchat.html) is a graphical, standalone
client written in Java, and runs anywhere there's a suitable Java runtime.

## jIRCii

[jIRCii](/clients/cross/jircii.html) is a barely graphical standalone Java
client, with a look and feel inspired by [ircII](/irchelp/clients/unix/ircii/) but taking advantage of
modern GUI functionality.

## HexChat
The popular XChat fork, [HexChat](./hexchat.html), originated as an unofficial Windows port, and now runs on Linux/Unix systems as well. A OSX port is available through Homebrew.

# Web Based Clients

Webchat interfaces are listed [elsewhere](/clients/webclients.html),
and are available anywhere there's a working web browser.

## Linux/Unix Clients on Windows

Many of the terminal-based Unix/Linux IRC clients have been ported to run on
Windows with the aid of Cygwin or MSYS. These ported clients may be awkward to use
if not comfortable with console-mode applications, and primarily cater to
advanced users.

The popular X11 client, xchat, also has a Windows version, which is a common
alternative to mIRC on Windows systems.

## Windows Clients on Linux/Unix/OSX

mIRC is known to [work well with Wine](http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=77).
