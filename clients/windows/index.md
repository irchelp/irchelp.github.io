## mIRC
Most users on Windows choose to use the popular shareware client, [mIRC](/irchelp/clients/windows/mirc/), which is available for a 30 day trial, and costs $20.00 after the trial period.

## XChat and derivatives
The popular Unix IRC client [XChat](/irchelp/clients/windows/xchat.html) and a number clients forked from it are also available for Windows.

## ChatZilla
[ChatZilla](/clients/cross/chatzilla.html) is a viable choice for Windows users, and a particularly compelling one for users who regularly switch between different platforms.
