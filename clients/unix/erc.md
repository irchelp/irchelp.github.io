The text editor and kitchen sink GNU emacs has a obscure, but built-in IRC client in the form of [ERC](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/erc.html).

ERC is included by default in v22.3 and above of GNU emacs, but some distributions may place it in a seperate package.

While ERC is primarily of interest to users of GNU emacs, it a fully functional, mature IRC client, with a small but dedicated community.

ERC is accessible inside emacs via the command "`M-x erc`".

Upon starting erc, prompts for the server to connect to appear in the emacs minibuffer.

Once the connection settings are entered, the client connects automatically, and an ERC > prompt appears in the buffer, where standard IRC commands can be entered. Channels and queries are opened as emacs buffers.
