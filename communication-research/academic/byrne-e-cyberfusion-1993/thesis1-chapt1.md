<h3>Chapter One : Literature Review</h3>

<b>Section One : Relationship Formation</b><p>

  

The formation of relationships has always been of interest to researchers of  

social psychology, but it was not until the 1970s that the bulk of theory began  

to emerge. It was during this time that a wide range of paradigms were  

developed, but "the domain of relationship development is awesomely vast  

and incompletely charted" (Duck &  Gilmour, 1981a, p vii). Two theories that  

emerged in the 70s were social penetration theory (Altman &  Taylor, 1973)  

and another based around attraction by Levinger and Snoek (1972). Both  

stem from the social psychological paradigm and offer two useful and  

complementary models of relationship development.   <p>

  

<h4>A. Social Penetration Theory  </h4>

  

Social Penetration theory was devised by Altman and Taylor in 1973 in an  

attempt to explain the development of interpersonal relationships from  

strangers to good friends. They propose that relationship formation will  

proceed gradually and in an orderly fashion, through reciprocal exchange  

from non-intimate, relatively unemotional aspects of the selves to intimate,  

private and vulnerable central core aspects of the selves (Duck &  Gilmour,  

1981a, p 15).  <p>

  

The events that occur in the formation of any relationship are, according to  

Altman and Taylor (1973), encompassed by four "social penetration  

processes": verbal exchange, nonverbal use of the body, use of physical  

environment, and interpersonal perceptions. All of these processes occur in  

different ways at different levels of intimacy and encounter.  <p>

  

Verbal behaviours provide the informational content of an interaction while  

nonverbal behaviour involves use of the body, such as postures and position,  

gestures, limb and head movements, facial expressions such as smiling, eye  

gaze, etc. Use of the physical environment includes manipulation of spatial  

features including personal space between people and of physical objects and  

areas. All of these communicative behaviours are accompanied by subjective,  

interpersonal perceptions as to what the other communicant is like.   <p>

  

Altman and Taylor (1973) also point out that many factors work along side  

communication to hinder or influence the formation of relationships. They  

put these into three classes. The first is the personal characteristics of the  

participants involved in the interaction. The looks, personality and social  

needs of each person in an interaction will influence how they manage the  

interaction. The second is the outcome of the exchange as to whether the  

participants liked one another or if they feel there is something to be gained  

from the relationship. The third and last is the situational context which will  

dictate whether the participants are free to enter or leave a relationship, or  

whether they are forced to maintain a tie because of social constraints.  <p>

  

Within the theory, Altman and Taylor (1973) make two hypotheses. The first  

hypothesis is "that interpersonal exchange gradually progresses over time  

from superficial, nonintimate areas to more intimate, deeper layers of the  

selves of the social actors. That people are generally believed to let others  

know them gradually" (Altman &  Taylor, 1973, p 10). This hypothesis  

postulates an 'onion skin' structure of personality. This suggests that a person  

has a series of layers to their personality. The outer layers are thought to hold  

the more physical characteristics (such as looks), while the inner layers hold  

aspects of personality. It is the social penetration process that people use to  

gradually and systematically move from the outer to the inner layers of  

personality and finally to the core or 'real' person.   <p>

  

When a relationship is developing, more and more layers of personality are  

stripped away and intimacy (defined as the degree of union with or openness  

towards another person) is said to increase as a result. Altman and Taylor  

(1973) point to self disclosure as the means by which people  move  from  the  

outer layers  to  the more  intimate levels  of  personality. They  categorise   

this  progression in four levels of relationship: a) orientation, b) exploratory  

affective exchange, c) affective exchange and d) stable exchange. As each of  

these levels are reached, both breadth (the content level) and depth (the  

intimacy level) of message content increase through reciprocal self disclosure.  

In the orientation level, initial contact is made with only peripheral aspects of  

personality accessible to the other. In the second level, more information is  

available to each other and the relationship tends to be friendly and casual  

without commitment. At the stage of affective exchange, the people involved  

get to know more about the central aspects of each other's personality, and as  

a result, become more vulnerable to each other. At the final level, the people  

are free to express spontaneously many aspects of their personalities and  

share private feelings and experiences (Altman &  Taylor, 1973, pp 138-139).   <p>

  

The second hypothesis is "that people assess interpersonal rewards and costs,  

dissatisfaction and satisfaction, gained from interaction with others, and that  

advancement of the relationship is dependent on the amount and nature of  

these. People assess interactions and predict implications of further  

exchanges. If the future looks favourable, the pair then move to more intimate  

levels of encounter" (Altman &  Taylor, 1973, p 12). This rewards/costs ratio is  

taken from social exchange models of relationship development. Exchange  

frameworks assume that the development of a relationship is based on the  

satisfactory exchange of rewards, like a form of currency, between partners.  

After initial attraction has occurred in a relationship, deeper involvement  

occurs when the partner provides rewards that are not easily available  

elsewhere and the levels of rewards are high enough to motivate the partners  

to intensify their involvement (Cate &  Lloyd, 1988, p 417).   <p>

  

Overall, Altman and Taylor (1973) recognise that within relationships, there is  

both the influence of personal perceptions as well as social and environmental  

factors. They also recognise that there is a great diversity of relationships in  

both form and content, but they seek to develop some general empirical and  

theoretical notions about the formation of relationships.  <p>



<h4>B. Attraction  </h4>

  

'Attraction' is readily recognised as an important aspect in the formation of  

relationships, but this is usually associated with a person's looks or  

appearance. However, the earliest work on attraction recognised that people  

where attracted to others for a number of reasons whether physical properties  

(Perrin, 1921, cited in Duck and Miell, 1984), behavioural features (Thomas &   

Young, 1938, cited in Duck and Miell, 1984) or personality and opinion  

characteristics (Richardson, 1939, cited in Duck and Miell, 1984). More  

recently, researchers have developed the idea that the main influence on  

attractiveness was not the pre-existing properties of individuals, but the  

relationship of these properties to one another. This research looks at  

personality similarity, complementarity of needs, physical appearance,  

matching of self esteem with other features of partner, and role congruence in  

the relationship (Duck &  Miell, 1984, p 230).   <p>

  

A theory developed by Levinger and Snoek (1972) has its basis in this  

attraction paradigm. They also use a 'filter' or 'stage' model to account for the  

different factors that come into play during the relationship formation  

process.   <p>

  

'Relationship' is a term commonly used to describe a romantic attachment  

between two people; however, the term has a more wide-ranging definition  

which encompasses any type of connection between people. Levinger and  

Snoek (1972) define relationships at three levels: Level 1 ( unilateral  

awareness, Level 2 ( surface contact, Level 3 ( mutuality.   <p>

  

<b>Level 1</b> relationships include an awareness of other people without enough  

contact to hold a conversation or for them to become aware of those who are  

aware of them. These relationships include the people seen each morning on  

the way to school, university or work. They also include the rock star on the  

radio or the person walking past in the street. At this level of relationship there  

is not only a perception of the other person, but a reaction of approval,  

disapproval or indifference occurs and yet they may pass on without ever  

exchanging a word.   <p>

<b>Level 2</b> relationships involve at least minimal interaction. These often occur  

with people who perform certain roles in society, for example, the bus driver,  

shop assistant or receptionist. Of course this is not always the case, there are  

some relationships of this level which occur in other situations such as with a  

Great Aunt who is hardly ever seen.  <p>

  

<b>Level 3</b> relationships are the ones that most people would term a 'relationship'.  

In these relationships there is real personal involvement and intimacy. The  

other person is perceived as a unique individual and their personal views are  

appreciated. Examples of this type of relationship are close friends and  

romantic attachments. However, Levinger and Snoek (1972) put romantic  

relationships into a special category of this level of relationship.   <p>

  

Levinger and Snoek (1972) point to the many factors or filters which are  

thought to influence and occur during the progression of relationships:  

physical proximity, social demographic similarity, physical attractiveness,  

attitude similarity, complementarity of needs, competence, self esteem,  

positive personal characteristics, reciprocity, and self disclosure.   <p>

  

Physical proximity is thought to play a large role in determining who will  

form a relationship. Most people form relationships with those who live in a  

similar geographical area. Physical proximity will often influence who  

becomes aware of each other and who relationships will begin to develop  

between (Festinger, Schachter and Back, 1950, cited in Forgas, 1989). In one  

study new arrivals at a police academy were allocated to class rooms and  

dormitories in alphabetical order. Everything they did together was in  

alphabetic order. At the end of six months, each trainee was asked who was  

their closest friend from the academy. On average, their closest friend was  

situated relatively close in proximity being only 4.5 letters removed in the  

alphabet from their own name. (Segal, 1974, cited in Forgas, 1989)  <p>

  

Social demographic similarity is also thought to influence the types of people  

who will form relationships. It is more likely that people will talk to and come  

into contact with people who are of the same ethnicity, religion, background,  

occupation, status, etc (Cate &  Lloyd, 1988, p 413). A study by Hollingshead  

and Redlich (1958, cited in Forgas, 1989) found that marriages, friendships,  

cliques and school groupings were largely made up of people who came from  

very similar social and demographic backgrounds.  <p>

  

Physical attractiveness has a particularly important role in the initial stages of  

relationship formation. It is often this factor alone that will influence someone  

to talk to another. A study by Walster, Aronson, Abrahams and Rothman  

(1966, cited in Forgas, 1989) found physical attractiveness to be the single  

best predictor of how much each person liked his or her assigned partner at a  

computer matched dance, even after couples had spent hours together.  <p>

  

Attitude similarity has more influence in relationships at the second level.  

Once a conversation has been established a person will begin to notice if the  

other person has similar attitudes about issues. It is thought that if another  

person with similar attitudes is discovered, then the relationship is more likely  

to be pursued (Duck &  Gilmour, 1981a, p 11-12).  <p>

  

Complementarity of needs is also noticeable in the second level of  

relationship. When two people talk it may be found that one has  

characteristics the other lacks and vice versa. Complementarity brings  

together people in relationships such as dominant/submissive,  

extrovert/introvert, and the like (Cate &  Lloyd, 1988, p 412).  <p>

  

Competence is a characteristic that will often play an important part in the  

formation of a relationship. It has been found that people are often attracted  

to others who are intelligent, successful and competent rather than those who  

are less so. However, this may have nothing to do with the perceived benefits  

of forming a relationship with that person. Of course, there may also be those  

who seem to be so perfect that they are unreal. In this scenario, it is better to  

have one glaring fault which will make a person appear at least 'human'  

(Aronson, 1976, cited in Forgas, 1989).  <p>

  

Self esteem also affects relationships at the second level. When self esteem is  

low, it is more likely that a person will target another who is less likely to  

reject them as potential communicants. If self esteem is high, then a person  

may feel that no one will reject them and may target people they would not  

normally talk to such as the prettiest girl in the class or the top executive of  

the company (Walster, 1965, cited in Forgas, 1989).  <p>

  

There are thought to be other positive personal characteristics which people  

view as good and therefore likeable in a person just as there are characteristics  

that are thought bad and therefore unlikeable. Studies have sought to find  

characteristics that fit into those two categories. There are obviously  

individual differences in what characteristics are likeable and what are  

unlikeable, but on the whole honesty and truthfulness are generally regarded  

highly (Hobfoll &  Stokes, 1988, p 502).  <p>

  

Balance in a relationship is preferable as it is very hard to continue a  

relationship that is all one sided. Reciprocity in the initial stages of a  

relationship often acts to encourage the continuation of a relationship. If  

someone is liked then they are more likely to like that other person. This  is   

also  the case for when someone is disliked (Burgess, 1981a, p 183).  <p>

  

Self disclosure is seen as an important factor in the continuation of  

relationships at both level 2 and 3 relationships. The more information that is  

disclosed, the more the other person will find out and in turn the other person  

will want to disclose information about themselves. Of course, if too much  

information is offered too soon by one person, the other person may be  

deterred from continuing the relationship. The converse is also true; if a  

person will not disclose anything, conversation becomes difficult and the  

interaction may terminate (Chelune, 1979). This view is similar to the  

importance that Altman and Taylor (1973) place on self disclosure.  <p>

  

Levinger and Snoek's (1972) model of relationship formation is useful in its  

definition of relationships and for the different factors that influence the  

relationship process.   <p>

  

<h3>Section Two ( Computer Mediated Communication  </h3>

  

The convergence of computers and telecommunications has led to a new  

medium for communication, allowing people to form relationships with each  

other via their computer even if the other person is on the opposite side of the  

globe. People are forming relationships with others whom they have never  

met in person with only the aid of text on a computer screen. The majority of  

research into CMC has dealt with the effects of new communication media,  

such as electronic mail on organisations (Sproull &  Keisler, 1991) as well as  

the effects of group decision-making via CMC (Hiltz, Johnson &  Turoff,  

1986). The focus here has typically been on task-related uses of CMC,  

however, more recent research has dealt with social uses (Steinfield, 1986;  

Hiltz &  Turoff, 1978) and the forming of interpersonal ties (Walther &   

Burgoon, 1992).  <p>

  

But what exactly is CMC? Rice (1984) defines the systems used in CMC as  

"media that facilitate the exchange of semantic content, transmitted through  

telecommunication networks, processed through one or more computers,  

between individuals and among groups" (p 438). Another definition comes  

from Walther (1992) who defines CMC as "synchronous or asynchronous  

electronic mail (email) and computer conferencing, by which senders encode  

in text their messages that are relayed from senders' computers to receivers'"  

(p 52). From the above definitions it can be ascertained that CMC is either  

asynchronous or synchronous and that it involves the exchange of messages  

first typed on one computer screen and sent to another person's computer in  

order for that person to read the message and reply appropriately.   <p>

  

Asynchronous CMC refers to applications such as electronic mail and  

network news which enables a person to send a message to another person's  

computer which is then stored until that person is able to read it and then  

reply. Asynchronous CMC has been available for much longer than  

synchronous CMC and as a result the bulk of research has been into this area.  <p>

  

Synchronous CMC deals with computer conferencing and 'real time'  

interaction. One example of this is 'talk' where two people are able to  

communicate simultaneously. Another form, which is the concern of this  

thesis, is IRC where many people are able to talk to each other at once in real  

time. In synchronous CMC people are able to communicate immediately with  

another person as if they were talking to them on a FTF basis. The research  

into this area is still in its early stages, but more studies are beginning to  

emerge (such as Reid, 1991, 1993; Rheingold, 1994).  <p>

  

<h4>Social Presence Theory  </h4>

  

A theory widely used by researchers of CMC is social presence theory. This  

theory was originally developed by Short, Williams and Christie (1976) for  

researching new telecommunications media. They suggest that these media  

can transcend time and distance, and convey only part of a communicator's  

presence. For them the social presence of a medium ( its ability to convey a  

communicator's presence ( was highest, in direct FTF communication (where  

both verbal and nonverbal cues were available) and much decreased, for  

example, in a business letter.  <p>

  

The original definition by Short et al (1976) was that they "regard Social  

Presence as being a quality of the communications medium. Although this is  

expected to affect the way individuals perceive their discussions, and their  

relationships to the persons with whom they are communicating, it is  

important to emphasise that Social Presence is defined as a quality of the  

medium itself" (p 65).   <p>

  

The hypothesis is that communications media vary in their degree of social  

presence, and that these variations are important in determining the way  

individuals interact. Social presence is, therefore, what Rice (1984) calls "the  

personal or social differentiating quality of communications acts". There is the  

feeling that other actors are jointly involved in communicative interaction.  

According to Short et al (1976), the fewer channels or codes available within a  

medium, the less attention is paid by the user to the presence of other social  

participants. As social presence declines, messages become less personal and  

more task oriented: "The capacity of a medium to transmit information about  

facial expression, direction of looking, posture, dress and non-verbal vocal  

cues, all contribute to its social presence." (Short et al, 1976, p 65)  

Initially CMC was thought to have low social presence because of its  

perceived absence of NVC to carry relational information in an interaction.  

This was thought to make it unsuitable for establishing relationships. These  

assumptions brought about the belief that CMC is "less friendly, emotional,  

or personal and more business like, or task oriented." (Rice and Love, 1987)   <p>

  

However, other research has found that there is a socialising aspect to CMC.  

Hiltz and Turoff (1978) reported the development of 'online communities',  

and other studies present cases of friendship development and warm relations  

on CMC (Steinfield, 1986). It was Walther (1992) who pointed out that  

humans are driven to interact with one another; just as communicators in any  

context should desire to transact personal, rewarding, complex relationships,  

so too do those people using CMC. He pointed out that people, given the  

opportunity to interact, will not merely contain their communications to  

business or task orientation, but will develop relationships despite using a  

medium that offers little or no NVC.   <p>

  

Despite this change in CMC research, social presence theory is still used as it  

provides a useful method for understanding how the medium of  

communication and users' perceptions of that medium alter the nature of  

communication in CMC.  <p>

  

<h3>Section Three ( Merging of the two Areas  </h3>

  

Theories of relationship development and CMC have been outlined above;  

however, it must be recognised that the relationship formation theories are  

designed for use at a FTF level and that social presence theory is not designed  

to study relationship development. So that interpersonal relationships can be  

researched within the context of CMC, the two areas will be converged. To  

achieve this, the three theories will be critically examined to develop a suitable  

framework.  <p>

  

There are three factors of social penetration theory which have attracted  

criticism: the rewards/costs ratio, the orderly and systematic progression of a  

relationship, and the 'onion skin' structure of personality.   <p>

  

First, the rewards/costs ratio is a very instrumental way of describing the  

decision that a person makes to continue a relationship or not. While the ratio  

was merely developed as a means of describing the process of that decision,  

obviously not all relationships are formed purely on the perceived benefits to  

oneself (Altman &  Taylor, 1973, p 184). This maybe seen in relationships  

where one person is in need and the person helping them does not appear to  

be gaining anything from the relationship.  <p>

  

Secondly, relationships rarely develop in an orderly and systematic way, and  

this is seen in the different rates at which some people will disclose  

information about themselves (Altman &  Taylor, 1973, p 183). Many  

relationships develop very quickly when an 'open' person initiates a  

communication, while other relationships may take months to develop  

because of distance or inability to communicate effectively. Some  

relationships may be constrained by the context they are within such as work  

or shared leisure activities.  <p>

  

Thirdly, the 'onion skin' structure of personality implies that people have  

layers of personality that must be stripped away to find the 'real' person. A  

question that emerges here is  whether  there  is  a real person to be found   

(Altman &  Taylor, 1973, p 187). There have been a number of different  

theoretical perspectives which have challenged the notion that there is a  

singular authentic core to the self. While the 'onion skin' structure is useful for  

understanding the process of finding out about a person, the issue of the real  

person or self at the middle of the onion needs to be addressed.   <p>

  

Levinger and Snoek's (1972) theory also comes up for criticism on three  

levels: the dispute over definition, the absence of the social, and the focus on  

intimate relationships.  <p>

  

First, there appears to be great confusion amongst theorists within the  

attraction paradigm over the definition of  key terms such as attraction, love,  

friendship, intimacy and so on. It is vital that these terms have a common  

definition so they can be interchanged and  understood  when  looking at  

other theorists' work (McCarthy, 1981, p 24-25).   <p>

  

Secondly, attraction theorists have not paid significant attention to the social  

significance of interactions between individuals. However, the 'filtering'  

approach does seek to address some aspects of the social. The various factors  

involved throughout a relationship are seen as an ongoing continuity in which  

people are continually making decisions about the relationship. Also, it shows  

that different features of a partner are relevant at different stages of a  

relationship. Hence, partners who fail to meet one of the criteria at any stage  

of the relationship will be filtered out of a group of friends. However, it is still  

only the features of social partners that had been explored, not the social  

features of partners ( and certainly not the social significance of the social  

processing of partners. (Duck &  Miell, 1984, p 231)   <p>

  

Thirdly, when studying the development of relationships, it is inevitable that  

some of these relationships may develop into love or marriage. Despite this  

acknowledgment, issues surrounding gender and power differences, identified  

by the rise of feminism, have not been taken into consideration. This criticism  

can apply to both social penetration and attraction theories. Altman and  

Taylor (1973) assume that the social penetration will be deeper if the  

relationship continues onto love or marriage, while Levinger and Snoek  

(1972) assume that if the relationship develops into love or marriage then  

attraction and information has increased and become more complex. Neither  

theorists take into consideration the differences that may be caused by the  

formation of relationships between two people of the same gender or two  

people of opposite genders. They fail to take account of the fact that  

relationships hardly ever occur between equals. No matter what relationship is  

analysed, there are always expected roles for each person which is often  

reflected in the 'power' that one has in relation to the other.  <p>

  

Social presence theory has also been held up for criticism. This theory has  

been criticised for its vague definition and its ability to explain CMC.  <p>

  

The vague definition of social presence theory has contributed to the debate  

in CMC literature as to whether it is the medium itself that alters  

communication or the perceptions of those using the medium that determines  

communication differences. Short et al (1976) state that social presence is a  

quality of the medium and that this will affect the way individuals  

communicate, however their research suggests that it is the users perceptions  

of the medium that will influence how they communicate. This uncertainty  

has been reflected in following studies into CMC (Steinfield, 1986). Both  

Walther (1992) and Rice (1984) state that it is important to look at both  

medium characteristics and user perceptions to obtain an accurate view of  

communication in a computer mediated environment.   <p>

  

The second criticism of social presence theory is aimed more at its use by  

CMC researchers. It was originally developed for studying new  

telecommunications media (audio and video teleconferencing) which do not  

have the same characteristics as CMC. As has already been noted, the use of  

this theory contributed to the early assumptions that CMC was less personal  

and more suited to task-related functions. These findings also led to the  

development of similar theories ( lack of social context cues (Sproull &   

Keisler, 1986, cited in Walther, 1992) and media richness (Daft &  Lengel,  

1984, cited in Walther, 1992) ( which suggest that the absence of NVC leads  

to CMC being defined as 'lean'. However, when relationships began to form  

through CMC it was necessary to question why this was happening. Walther  

and Burgoon (1992) offered one solution to the problem by stating that  

limited time for experiments was the reason for earlier research findings. They  

pointed out that the impersonal aspects of CMC were limited to initial  

encounters between users. He said that researchers had not allowed enough  

time for experiments and so the interpersonal ties were not manifesting  

themselves. It was only after longer periods of time that relationships began to  

develop in any substantial manner.   <p>

  

After looking at the criticisms of each theory three major points can be  

identified: the effect of the medium on communication, problems of  

presenting and perceiving the self, and the issue of power in relationships.  

Each of these will be discussed in the following chapters.  <p>

  

However, despite the theories' short fallings, there are useful parts of each one  

which can be utilised and brought together.   <p>

  

Social penetration theory is useful for its recognition of relationship  

development as an ongoing process, its use of verbal, nonverbal,  

environmental and personal perceptions as factors of relational development,  

and its recognition that there is a great diversity of relationships. It must also  

be acknowledged that the rewards/costs ratio is part of the theory but needs to  

be made more flexible and subjective for each different relationship. The  

'onion skin' structure of personality will be investigated in the section on the  

self but the gradual and systematic progression of relationships will be  

disregarded.  <p>

  

The attraction theory is useful for its definition of the different levels of  

relationship. It is also useful for its 'filtering' approach which provides a range  

of factors affecting different stages of the process of relationship formation  

without limiting it to self disclosure as in social penetration theory.   <p>

  

Social presence theory is useful as it points to the medium as the  

differentiating source in the alteration of communication. It also points to  

personal perceptions as playing a role in the way communication is affected.  

It will not be assumed automatically that social presence is low, but this will  

be tested out in the section on medium.  <p>

  

This brings about a framework that enables the investigation of the ongoing  

process of relationship development through a series of filters in an altered  

medium of communication.   <p>

  

<h3>Section Four : Methodology  </h3>

  

Many of the limitations and problems with the research on CMC and  

interpersonal relationships, are the result of researchers only working from  

one method or one theoretical framework. A general criticism of the relational  

literature is that theorists have tried to fit the complex investigation of  

interpersonal relationships into a singular paradigm. Social presence theory  

was criticised for limiting its research to laboratory settings using simulated  

tasks and unrepresentative ad hoc groups (Rice, 1984, p 61). As a result, Rice  

(1984) says that there is a need to rethink the contexts and paradigms by  

which CMC research is organised. There is a need to inspect assumptions,  

theoretical perspectives, implementation, and analyses of CMC. This view is  

also expressed in relation to the interpersonal relationship literature by  

Morton and Douglas (1981) who state that the current array of theories and  

methods may not be sufficient to navigate the vastness of relationship  

development.   <p>

  

There is also concern that researchers are limiting their methods of  

investigation. By only conducting laboratory experiments, or only distributing  

surveys, the study becomes limited in its ability to make generalisations that  

apply to their area of study. This implies a need for cross validity: the more  

methods used in a study, the wider the range and accuracy of results can be  

obtained. Altman and Taylor (1973) provide a good example of cross validity.  

In researching social penetration theory, they used short and long term  

laboratory experiments, field questionnaires, social isolation studies, and role  

playing studies to understand the complex nature of relationship formation.  <p>

  

A range of methods also allow both quantitative and qualitative approaches.  

Rice (1984) states that research using only quantitative methods, such as  

manipulated experiments, seldom provide a satisfactory understanding of  

behaviour in a new communication medium. By including qualitative  

research, a more fuller understanding can be obtained of the subject beyond  

statistical data.   <p>

  

In addition, multiple methods also point to a mixture of positivist and  

interpretative frameworks. A positivist framework implies that there are exact  

causes of particular effects, while an interpretative framework allows for  

human agency and interpretation of results by the researcher (Littlejohn,  

1989). Research on relationships in CMC has arrived at many different  

conclusions that would imply that there is no right or wrong answer. It is  

therefore important to make room for interpretation of results and to give  

humans agency in which their perceptions are important.  <p>

  

Taking these limitations into consideration, it is necessary to have a  

methodology that draws upon a variety of theoretical approaches as well as  

encompassing differing methods of investigation. For this thesis, four  

methods were used: literature review, on-line surveys, FTF interviews and  

session logging.  <p>

  

An extensive literature review was undertaken so as to understand the issues  

that are involved with the study of cyberspace. It was necessary to do this to  

understand the context in which relationships were being formed and the  

ways in which users perceived their relationships on IRC. The literature  

review also helped to define the issues and questions that the thesis was to  

address. In the previous sections of this chapter, the main literature was  

outlined and the questions and problems to be addressed were isolated.  
<p> Surveys were distributed to users of IRC by means of an IRC emailing list. 
  This list consists of a majority of users from channel (#) Aussies most of whom 
  are Australian with a few from other countries. Approximately 100 people received 
  surveys with only half of them being returned. The questions asked included 
  simple demographic information as well as asking users about their use of IRC 
  and their experiences with relationships. The information gained provided statistical 
  and generalisable information about the formation of relationships on IRC. (For 
  a copy of the survey please see the <a href="/irchelp/communication-research/academic/byrne-e-cyberfusion-1993/thesis1-rest.html#append">Appendix.</a>) 
<p>

  

Interviews were conducted with five different users of IRC on a FTF level.  

These five people each outlined specific relationships they have had with  

people on IRC. The interviews were not based on a set of fixed questions, but  

instead were open ended and loosely structured to allow the interviewees to  

generate their own narratives about their experiences on IRC. The  

interviewees were volunteers and their information provided more detailed  

and personal information about relationship formation than did the surveys.  

When quoting them in the body of the thesis, only the first initial of their IRC  

nick is used to ensure anonymity.  <p>

  

Many IRC sessions were logged over an 11-month period from December  

1993 to October 1994 at random times to record the everyday happenings of  

IRC. The majority of logs were from #Aussies, however, on occasion logs of  

other channels were recorded when people wished to talk about a specific  

experience they had had. The people on #Aussies were made aware of the  

fact they were being logged but they did not know when in particular as the  

logs were random. For use in the thesis, the logs were stored in their complete  

form and useful parts were isolated and reproduced with the original spelling.  

Omissions to the quotes are marked by three dots where information was  

irrelevant or to protect the privacy of some individuals. Permission was  

gained from all people quoted in the body of the thesis. By logging events on  

the one channel, trends in the behaviour of a particular group of people could  

be observed including the formation of new relationships and the maintaining  

of already established ones. The logs showed an accurate picture of what  

happens on IRC including relationship formation and avoidance, chatting,  

joking, fighting, etc.  <p>
