# IRCNet ircd

IRCNet's [IRCD](<https://github.com/ircnet/irc) is in fact the original IRCD, from
which most others are directly descended.

IRCNet has evolved a number of unique network features, including collisionless channels,
modeless channels, and reopping, which are incorporated into its IRCD.
