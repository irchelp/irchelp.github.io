#IRC Clients

Unlike web-based chat, IRC uses software on your computer (a "client") to connect to an IRC server. This gives you a great deal of choice in where and how you use IRC. IRC clients exist for every major operating system, and many of the more obscure ones. 

We list IRC clients by operating system.:

* [Windows](/irchelp/clients/windows/)
* [MacOS X](/irchelp/clients/mac/)
* [Linux/Unix](/irchelp/clients/unix/)
* [Smartphone](/irchelp/clients/mobile/)
* [Crossplatform](/irchelp/clients/cross/)
* [Other Operating Systems](/irchelp/clients/otheros)

For users who want to get started without installing a client, there are a number of [web-based clients and gateways](/irchelp/clients/webclients.html) that you may be able to use to try IRC in your browser.
