This page provides a brief description for all the common [denial of service
attacks](index.html) commonly seen in IRC. The following are listed in
approximately reverse chronological order (most recent attacks first):

  1. SMB
  2. bonk
  3. land
  4. teardrop
  5. click
  6. ssping
  7. WinNuke
  8. ICMP Flood
  9. smurf

Windows 95/NT users should first read the [Introduction](index.html) section
which will show you a series of steps that will protect you against many
common nukes.

Macintosh users should rejoice. MacOS is impervious to most OS attacks. Be
sure you're using OpenTransport (not MacTCP) under MacOS 8.x and you should be
safe.

Linux users are also in good shape if you're running a reasonably current
[kernel](http://www.kernel.org/) (at least 2.0.33 and 2.1.73).

* * *

### SMB

> **Aliases/variants:** Server Message Block (SMB) logon attack

>

> **Affects:** Windows NT4

>

> **Symptoms:** System hang or restart. Widespread attacks especially against
.edu and .gov sites in spring of '98.

>

> **Patches and Info:** See the [Microsoft help
page](http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q180/9/63.asp) last
updated 4/10/1999.

* * *

### bonk

> **Aliases/variants:** boink, newtear, teardrop2

>

> **Affects:** Windows 95 / NT4

>

> **Symptoms:** Blue screen freeze and crash. If you have been patched since
12/97 against the other nukes below and as of 1/8/98 suddenly started to get
the blue screen, you're probably being "bonked".

>

> **Patches:** Microsoft just released a new [patch for Win 95 winsock
2](http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/info/ws2.htm) that covers this attack
(after nearly 2 months!). Patches already exist for Win NT4 and Win 95 Winsock
1 at the [#mIRC nuke information page](http://mirc.stealth.net/nuke/).

>

> **For more info:** See Microsoft's
[bulletin](http://www.microsoft.com/security/newtear2.htm) last updated in
late February.

* * *

### land

> **Affects:** Windows 95 / NT / 3.11, many others

>

> **Symptoms:** Freeze and crash. You're probably being "landed" if you were
nuke-safe until mid-November or if you're already patched against the other
nukes.

>

> **Patches:** Windows 95/NT, see the Operating System Attacks in
[Introduction](index.html).

>

> **For more info:** See the excellent article from [Wired
News](http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/8707.html).

* * *

### teardrop

> **Aliases/variants:** tear, TCP/IP fragment bug, overlapfrag bug

>

> **Affects:** Windows 3.1/95/NT, Linux (before 2.0.32 and 2.1.63)

>

> **Symptoms:** Immediate crash or reboot. If you know you're safe against
"winnuke" and "ssping" below and you still crash, you are probably suffering
from either "land" or "teardrop". If you just get disconnected it's probably
"click".

>

> **Patches:**

>

>   * Windows 95/NT: see Operating System Attacks in
[Introduction](index.html).

>   * Linux: upgrade to 2.0.32 / 2.1.63 or later.

>

> **For more info:** Visit the teardrop page at
[WinPlanet](http://winplanet.com/features/reports/netexploits/index4.html).

* * *

### click

> **Aliases/variants:** [the original] nuke, ICMP nuke, ICMP_REDIRECT or
ICMP_DEST_UNREACH spoof, WinNewk/WinNewk-X

>

> **Affects:** All IRC users unless protected by firewall or other filter.

>

> **Symptoms:** You are disconnected from the IRC server but otherwise your
connection to your ISP is fine. Your computer does not crash. Others will
usually see you quit with the message "Connection reset by peer" although
other networking related error messages are also possible.

>

> **Patches:** There is no patch against this networking attack, although
certain "personal" firewall products can stop these attacks (see [Networking
Attacks](index.html#netattack)). Otherwise, you can try using different server
ports other than 6667 every time you connect, or try using other servers,
since some seem to be less vulnerable than others.

* * *

### ssping

> **Aliases/variants:** jolt, sPING, ICMP bug, IceNewk, "Ping of Death".

>

> **Affects:** Windows 95 / NT, and many others!

>

> **Symptoms:** Computer locks up, usually requiring a reboot (reset switch
such as _ctrl+alt+del_ doesn't work). After restart, computer runs as usual.

>

> **Patches:**

>

>   * Windows 95/NT: see Operating System Attacks in
[Introduction](index.html).

>   * Other platforms: see [The Ping o' Death
Page](http://www.sophist.demon.co.uk/ping/)

>

> **For more info:** See the ssping pages at
[WinPlanet](http://winplanet.com/features/reports/netexploits/index3.html) and
[winfiles.com](http://www.winfiles.com/bugs/icmp.html).

* * *

### WinNuke

> **Aliases/variants:** Windows OOB bug.

>

> **Affects:** Windows 95 / 3.11 / NT

>

> **Symptoms:** "Blue Screen" (virtual device driver) error. Computer usually
recovers, but Internet connection doesn't, requiring reboot (usual shutdown
procedure _should_ work). May also cause computer to lock up.

>

> **Patches:**

>

>   * Win95/NT: see Operating System Attacks in [Introduction](index.html)

>   * Win 3.1x (courtesy of Tjerk Vonck):

>     1. Find SYSTEM.INI on the boot drive of your computer

>     2. Directly under the caption [MSTCP] in SYSTEM.INI insert this line:

`BSDUrgent=0`

>

> **For more info:** See the winnuke pages at
[WinPlanet](http://winplanet.com/features/reports/netexploits/index2.html) and
[winfiles.com](http://www.winfiles.com/bugs/oob.html).

* * *

### ICMP flood

> **Aliases/variants:** ping flood, ICMP_ECHO flood

>

> **Affects:** all modem connections

>

> **Symptoms:** Modem lights go berserk indicating overflow of information,
Internet applications get very slow, after 15-60 secs you get disconnected
(from your server or even your provider). Everything is fine after reconnect
(unless you get flooded again), no crash or reboot.

>

> **Patches:** There are no patches available or possible, since this attack
directly exploits the low capacities of your modem. For more information, see
the firewall section of [Networking Attacks](index.html#netattack).

* * *

### smurf

> **Affects:** whole provider or IRC server

>

> **Symptoms:** Imagine ICMP flooding for an entire provider or server.
Everybody connected gets bogged down and kicked off, attack can last for hours
or days.

>

> **Patches:** There is nothing you can do to defend yourself against this,
but if you do have any information on who is doing the attack, contact the
admins at your ISP or IRC server (whichever is being attacked). Again, no
personal firewalls can protect you (see [Networking
Attacks](index.html#netattack) for explanation).

>

> **For more info:** See the
[WinPlanet](http://winplanet.com/features/reports/netexploits/index5.html)
article which is based on a [guide by Craig Huegen](http://www.quadrunner.com
/%7Ec-huegen/smurf.txt).
