# General IRC Networks

_Selected networks with several hundred to several thousand users_

* * *

updated Mar 15, 2003

This page is part of the [IRChelp.org Networks
Site](http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/networks/), please do not mirror or
distribute.

We've set up separate pages to highlight some of the [most
popular](popular.html) nets (with over 10,000 people), or those serving a
special [local region](local.html) or [subject area](subject.html). That still
leaves hundreds of general networks. If you really want a full list, check out
the [netsplit.de](http://irc.netsplit.de/networks/) 3rd party statistics site
[ext. link]. We highlight just a few of these small to medium networks below.
They are not necessarily the best or biggest nets. We just want to give you
some suggestions if you're new to IRC and looking for a general chat network.
If you're fed up with the chaos of the [popular nets](popular.html), many of
these nets have full services and can be a reasonable place for you to either
start or move your channel. Networks are listed alphabetically.

[NewNet](http://www.newnet.net/)

Started: April 1996

Administrative channel: #idleland

[WebNet](http://www.webchat.org/)

back then, this network has developed into a very decent alternative to the
major ones. Showcase for the (commercial) Conference Room ircd.

Services: Channel (ChanServ), Nick (NickServ), Memo (MemoServ)
