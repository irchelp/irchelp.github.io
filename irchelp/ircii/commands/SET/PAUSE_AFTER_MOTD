Usage: SET PAUSE_AFTER_MOTD [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
  When ON, this will cause IRCII to wait for a keystroke after
  the local IRCII motd is displayed then clear the screen and
  continue.  If OFF, the local motd will be displayed,
  immediately followed by the server banners and motds.  If
  there is no local IRCII motd, this variable has no effect.
  PAUSE_AFTER_MOTD only works for the IRCII motds and *not* for
  server motds.
