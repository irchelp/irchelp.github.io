Usage: WINDOW CREATE
  Creates a new ircII window by either opening a new 'screen' window
  or 'xterm' window depending on the environment.  'screen' is a 
  popular program which allows multiple windows to be recalled under
  unix and displayed one at a time on even a vt100 terminal.
  The X environment is a graphical interface for high resolution
  monitors usually attached to UNIX machines.

  Currently, all xterms must be the same size as each other.
