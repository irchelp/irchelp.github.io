Usage: ENCRYPT [<nickname>|<channel> [<key>]]
  ENCRYPT allows you to hold an encrypted conversations with 
  a person or a whole channel.  Once a nickname/channel and
  key is specified, all messages you send to that 
  nickname/channel will automatically be encrypted using the
  given key.  Likewise, any messages from that nickname/channel
  will automatically be decrypted. ircII is smart enough to know
  if the incoming message isn't encrypted and will not attempt to 
  decrypt it.  If you received an encrypted message from someone
  for whom you haven't specified a key, it will be displayed as
  [ENCRYPTED MESSAGE].

  The <key> can be any text which is to be used an they key 
  for encryption/decryption of the conversation.  It is up to
  you and the people you wish to talk to about how to agree upon 
  a key and how to communicate it to one another.

  For example, if user CheeseDog wishes to talk encryptedly with
  user DogCheese, they must first agree on an encryption key
  (case sensitive), say foo.  Then user CheeseDog must issue a
    ENCRYPT DogCheese foo
  and user DogCheese must issue a 
    ENCRYPT CheeseDog foo
  Thereafter, all messages sent between CheeseDog and DogCheese
  will be encrypted and decrypted automatically.  

  If ENCRYPT is given with a nickname but no key, then encrypted
  conversation is ended with that user.  If ENCRYPT is given with
  no arguments, the list of encrypted user and keys are
  displayed.

  IrcII uses a built in encryption method that isn't terribly secure.
  You can use another if you so choose, see SEE ENCRYPT_PROGRAM
  for information about this.
 
  If you are sending encrypted messages to a user or channel, you
  can toggle it off and on in a message line by inserting the
  control-E character in the input line.  This is usually done
  by hitting control-Q then control-E.  An inverse video E will
  appear in the input line.  

Note:
  Control-q is bound (see BIND) to quote_character by default.
  It is frequently necessary to change this to some other char.
