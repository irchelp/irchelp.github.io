Usage: LOAD basical
  Basical aliases are defined here, so to make ircII behave according
  to the old ircI standards. This script should always be loaded from
  the global ircrc, you should already have these things defined.

Additionnal commands available:
  CHOP <nick>	   Make a person channel-op of your current channel.
  K <nick>         Kick person from current channel.
  MO <modechange>  Make a mode change on the current channel.

  WDETECTED        Whois of the last person detected by /notify.

  These were kept for compatibility:
