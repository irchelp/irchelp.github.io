Usage: LOAD oldping
  This was the last ping script made for ircII2.2pre7
  Its use is highly discouraged: ircII2.2 has a PING command
  and thus does not need a ping alias.  If you need to ping someone
  you know is using an old client, then you can load this script
  and it should work.

Additionnal commands available:
  PING <nickname> will hopefully give you a response that 
  will tell you how long it took to send a message to that person 
  and to get a reply.  Not all clients answer automatically, so 
  don't expect it to always work.
