**Not cool...**
## "Hackers" -- People who think it's cool to be a jerk.

Unfortunately, one of the problems with the internet is that there are some
lifeless losers who believe the only way to have fun is to hassle other
people. To them, the internet is one big playground over which they can roam
and bully others. They tend to hang out together online, seeking mutual
admiration for what lowlife they are. Of course, they think they are "cool."

Many of you may realize that I'm not using the term "hackers" in its correct
sense. (See [an editorial](http://www.infowar.com/hacker/hackb.html-ssi) on
this.) But I'm using the term that the electronic terrorists use for
themselves, so in a sense, I'm accurate. They want to think of themselves as
hackers. So I'll call them hackers, even though they don't possess the
technical expertise required for traditional hacking--and probably never will.
Everybody knows that it takes no great genius to send anonymous email to
somebody saying, "fuck you." And a person doesn't have to be a system engineer
to message somebody on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) with "get a life, asshole,"
and then change his nick so he can't be found. These things are easy.
Amazingly, though, the people who do these things generally believe that they
are accomplishing some great technical feat. The "anonymous" email that these
lowlife send usually isn't as anonymous as they think it is. See [this
link](http://www.one800.net/case-study.html), and the case study that follows
at the end of it, to see how easily "hackers" are tracked. The link also shows
how conceited and how stupid these "hackers" are in general.

The type of "hacker" I'm talking about typically spends all or most of his
free time on the net in search of people to screw with. He tries to justify
his actions by saying that "sometimes" it's for revenge--somebody has screwed
with him, and he needs to get even. But this explanation falls apart when such
hackers stupidly admit, when asked, that they also hassle people who have
never caused them a bit of trouble.

So here we have a person who considers it a great injustice when somebody is
rude to him. But he freely practices the same thing--**_and more_**--toward
other people. Do such people actually believe they are right and the rest of
the world is wrong? Do they actually believe they can do _anything _and it's
okay, but others are bound by stricter moral standards? There is a word for
this: _hypocrisy._

The primary playground of these pseudo-hackers appears to be IRC. It's easy to
hassle people on IRC. There are many people there. But what passes for
"hacking" on IRC is really the electronic equivalent of throwing rocks at
people. That's all. There is no real hacking involved at all. Just hassling
people.

One of the instructive things about hackers like these are that they become
very offended if you even discuss what they do. To them, _you_ are the one
wrong, because you talk about their actions and ask questions they would
rather not answer. (They will answer your questions at first, but when they
realize their answers are ridiculous and filled with double standards, they
accuse you of interfering with their enjoyment of the net--this from the same
people who get their "enjoyment" by maliciously interfering with others'
enjoyment!)

Equally stupid is another rationale these morons use. They say that if the
victim had had better security, he wouldn't have been attacked. Has vandalism
_ever_ been justified by the victim not nailing down or locking up his
property tightly enough? I don't think so. This mentality is common among the
jerk-hackers. Blame the victim, although the hacker is the one who chose to
harass or destroy, set out to do it, and did exactly what he chose to do. If
this justification works, it's only by concluding that hackers have no control
over their minds or muscles; they are lifeless automons. Well, I'm not buying
it. It's like blaming the woman for getting raped.

The double standards are clear. But these hackers go further, and try to put
down others for their normal, peaceful enjoyment of the internet. It might
surprise many people to learn that these hackers consider you a "loser" or a
"lamer" if you use the internet for it's intended purposes, are courteous to
people, and don't try to destroy what others build. By contrast, they consider
themselves "elite." By that, they mean that they are "cool" or somehow more
intelligent or resourceful in that they are able to do something as simple as
type "fuck you" to somebody. It doesn't make sense, but there it is.

For all the egos these people have, they are amazingly incompetent. Look at
this usenet post:

Hmmmm... a hacker in search of friends? And he doesn't even know how to join a
channel on IRC?

These hackers even have their own type of language that they type in. They are
"elite." Everybody else is "lame." But they are not just cool dudes, they are
"c00L d00dz." The substitution of digits for letters and the intentional
mixing of case appears to be some kind of identification badge. (Can I be a
c00L d00d, too? I d0N't kNoW iF i hAvE the aBiLitY!) It appears to be similar
to gang slang or secret handshakes.

How does one become a hacker? How is this level of accomplishment reached?
Suppose you wanted to be a hacker on IRC. What would you do? It's simple! Just
post a Usenet article asking people to tell you how to do it! As this person
did:

Now let's take a look at a guy who likes to do "nice things" on IRC.

"Thug4Life" just can't do his "nice stuff" yet, because he doesn't have any

Download a file.... that's genius!

By now, some might be wondering what the "real" hackers think of hacking IRC.

Yes, you'll see this again and again in the Usenet newsgroups. Some wanna-be
comes in, thinking he's c00L or "elite", and makes a fool of himself. Real
hackers tell him that he's a lamer. Here is one that goes into more detail on
why today's cool jerks are not what they think they are. It was in response to
a question as to the difference between a "hacker" and a "cracker."

`Cracker&nbsp_place_holder;`

`The definition of a cracker is one who attempts to break into a system via`
`cracking/guessing user passwords. Most of the crackers are young teenage`
`punks who are very malicious and seek to get their kicks from destroying or`
`alternating data on a system. The media often times mistakes the cracker`
`for the hacker. Also note that a cracker's level of education/intelligence`
`on the system and its inner workings etc. is very low.`

`Hacker&nbsp_place_holder;`

`The hacker on the other hand is an individual who yearns for knowledge. The`
`hackers are very knowledgeable individuals. They often times know several`
`programming languages, work extensively with the inwards and outwards of`
`UNIX, have a firm understanding of all the TCP/IP implementations and`
`protocols. They keep abreast on all the security related issues involving`
`computers. Breaking into a system for a hacker is a thrill, it is a`
`challenge that they take on. The hacker takes much delight in exploring the`
`system from the outside/inside searching vigorously for misconfigurations,`
`bugs, and holes in the operating system that would allow them to break into`
`a machine. Once in the system the challenge has been completed and they`
`have succeeded in breaking in. It is against hacker ethics to alter any`
`data aside from the logs that are needed to clean their tracks. They have`
`no need or desire to destroy data as the malicious crackers. They are there`
`to explore the system and learn more. The hacker has a constant yearning`

`and thirst for knowledge that increases in intensity as their journey`
`progresses.`

You may have heard of the "hacker riot" at AOL on February 14. Rather than
hacking, it was just a group of losers (mostly teenagers, it seems) feeding
off adulation for one another and general harrassment of users who where there
to use the service normally. Sure, they call themselves hackers. But they are
not real hackers. They are just jerks. See [AOL "riot" falls
short](http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,7965,00.html?related) on the C-Net
news service for a report of the so-called hacker riot.

* * *

I've referred to the new-age hackers as "lifeless losers." Those people
disagree with me, of course. They think their lives are rich and full. I'll
give an example of some c00L d00d who claimed he was somehow better than me,
and told me that I needed to get a life. It happened this way. I was on IRC,
minding my own business, chatting with people who wanted to chat with me.
Suddenly, I was invited to a certain channel. I had my software set up to
auto-join channels I was invited to. So next thing I know, I was in a new
channel. I said hi to everybody, then I was kicked from the channel. Then I
was invited again. And kicked again. The different people in that channel got
a thrill in taking turns doing this. I politely asked them to stop it. They
didn't. After a few minutes, seeing that this was going to continue, I turned
off auto-invite. Next, I start getting private messages from them, filled with
obscenities. So I responded in kind, telling them what was on my mind.

After a while, with the "ignore" function, I managed to get things under
control. One of the "hackers" told me that he didn't appreciate my language,
especially the language to his girlfriend. (He made no comment on his
girlfriend's language to me.) He said I had been rude to her--but made no
mention of how she was in on the fun that started it all. After some inquiries
from me, he admitted that he had never met this girl, but he's in love with
her, and he defends her from everybody who would mess with her. (He ignored
that I never had heard of her or chatted with her until she and the others
started screwing with me.) He asked me some questions about programming,
saying I was a lamer and loser for not knowing the answers. When I answered
his questions, correctly, he said, "so what--that doesn't mean anything."
(That's another trait of the "hackers." What they think is significant is
suddenly nothing at all when you show them up. They cannot make up their
minds.)

Does this sound like a person with a life? The gallant white knight riding to
the defense of his slut girlfriend whom he has never met and probably will
never meet?

I managed after a while to chat with the "girlfriend" some. She's in love with
the jerk who came to her defense. She thinks he is cool. She admires his
technical knowledge. She thinks what he does is exciting, daring, and
romantic. She also tried to throw some religion at me, but when I quoted the
Bible at her, she didn't want to talk about religion any more. (See the double
standard?)

Why did all of this happen? They didn't like one of the channels I was in. So
they decided to teach me a lesson. They even got some friends to try to send
me some trojan files that would damage the data and programs on my computer.
Oh, and they said it was _my_ fault that I kept getting invited to their
channel and kicked out. You see, I had auto-invite on, so that means _I _was
to blame for what they did. That they purposely invited and kicked me
repeatedly is meaningless in determining who was at fault for what _they_ were
doing. This is like blaming the victim of a mugging because he dared to leave
his house!

A hacker once asked me if I hacked on IRC. I said no, I have a life. He asked
me how old I was, and when I told him I was 43, he said that at that age, I
couldn't possibly have a life. What does this kind of stupid, narrow-minded
thinking indicate about such a person's intelligence or life experience? I
think it indicates the nonexistence of both.

From time to time, I get on IRC and create a channel whose title indicates my
distaste for hacker-jerks. Sometimes hackers see the channel and join. One
hacker decided he didn't like my having the same right he had (he had created
his own pro-hacker channel), so he decided I needed to be taught a lesson, and
he proceeded to flood me off the server. Nothing happened to me, but he did
manage to flood himself off three times. After that, he left me alone.

I'll say it again. These people are lifeless losers who have egos all out of
proportion to their importance to the world. Their technical competence is
minimal (if it exists at all), their love lives consist solely of online
chatting, and they offer hypocritical justifications for their self-imposed
mission of terrorizing people who are minding their own business and using the
internet as it was intended. The one thing they can do a lot is brag and
admire each other for the jerks they are, while they stupidy demonstrate their
lack of decency, morals, and intelligence.

* * *

I realize that these examples are subject to the criticism that they are
isolated and extreme, and do not accurately represent the general "hacker"
personality. But keep in mind I'm not talking about the traditional hacker.
I'm talking about those who have set themselves a misson of destroying what
others have created or disrupting others who simply want to enjoy the
internet.

So this is what "hacking" has come to. A hacker used to be somebody who
explored and learned things. Today, sadly, "hackers" are people who download
files (by clicking a mouse pointer on a file name), set them up (by double
clicking a mouse pointer on a file name), and run them (by double clicking a
mouse pointer on an icon.) They like to think they are superior and more
intelligent than everybody else. In fact, they are incredibly stupid people
with incredibly large egos. They like to think they have a better life than
everybody else, when in fact they have a pitiful life, if any life at all.

Many hackers (the true, traditional kind of hacker) have written to me and
expressed their agreement.&nbsp_place_holder; I appreciate that
feedback.&nbsp_place_holder; But the new, punk type of "screw people for the
hell of it" hackers don't have much good to say about my
views.&nbsp_place_holder; Some of them have told me that they are really
"creators," and the world should be grateful for their
existence.&nbsp_place_holder; Sadly, these people somehow don't see the
difference between creating something and destroying something for the heck of
it.&nbsp_place_holder; Creating something takes work, imagination, and
skill.&nbsp_place_holder; Destroying something just takes a
hammer.&nbsp_place_holder; I think this is self-evident to
anybody.&nbsp_place_holder; Therefore, I completely reject the new hackers'
notion that they are God's gift to mankind because they try their best to make
the world miserable.&nbsp_place_holder; I have no use for them, and based on
the feedback I'm getting, many decent people are fed up with their antics.

From what I've seen of the hacker punks, they have no skills at all--whether
it be social, literary, or technical.&nbsp_place_holder; Let's assume, for the
moment, however, that destroying does take the great skill that the
illiterate, uneducated punks claim it takes.&nbsp_place_holder; Why, then, do
they want to destroy, rather than build and create?&nbsp_place_holder; Why do
they brag about a skill that is used only to terrorize people and make life
harder for everybody else.&nbsp_place_holder; If that is a skill at all, what
use is that skill? Why would the world appreciate a skill that is demonstrated
only with anitsocial behavior?&nbsp_place_holder; I wish the "hackers" would
answer that question.

### Asking me for more info

I didn't expect it, but a surprising number of visitors to this site have
asked me for more information on hackers and hacking. There's nothing wrong
with asking. Maybe I'll even know the answer. I'll at least try to reply. Let
me make it clear that I am not an expert on hacking. I've had some experience
with hackers. They've tried to send me trojan files that would damage my
computer, for example. And I've been harrassed in IRC plenty of times simply
because I was there and somebody wanted a random thrill. But I haven't done
any academic studies on hackers--either the traditional true hacker, or on the
modern-day stupid jerk variety. Here I'm only writing what I do know. Some
people have also asked me the how-to's of certain hacking techniques. Well, I
am a programmer, I do know a bit about computers, and I know how to screw them
up. Programmers learn these things out of necessity. So when I'm on IRC and
somebody tries to send me a so-called erotic picture in a 500-byte file called
NUDE.COM, or somebody tries to send me a "cool puzzle program" that is
300-bytes big, I know what's going on.

The two differences between me and the modern malicious "hackers" is that (1)
I know a hell of a lot more than they do about computers, and (2) I don't use
my knowledge to hurt innocent people. Yet, I'm considered a "lamer" by those
who know next to nothing about how a computer works, simply because I choose
to be a decent person rather than use my knowledge to commit cheap, anonymous
electronic vandalism.

If you are looking to me for advice on "how to hack," don't expect much. Look
elsewhere, and when you find it, and download whatever program you are looking
for, you can be proud that you are a genius because you know how to double
click your mouse on a program's icon.

I also want to make it clear that I do not condone _any_ hacking--traditional
or the jerk kind--that invades a person's privacy or tresspasses on a person's
property when that person is not using his computer to do anything wrong. If
you get caught trying to snoop into forbidden places, you know the rules of
the game, and you should take what's coming to you when you get caught.
Recently, a [hacker who screwed around with AOL was convicted](http://www.zdne
t.com/zdnn/content/pcwo/0108/pcwo0016.html).&nbsp_place_holder; And what
happens when you monkey around with the president's email address? Wouldn't
that be KewL? Yeah. A KewL way to get the secret service on your ass. See the
article from [Time Magazine](http://pathfinder.com/@@ItUBxgYAVZ51NnDS/time/mag
azine/domestic/1996/960318/technology.html) . And take a look at the resources
being put onto catching whoever [hacked the NCAA
site](http://www.infowar.com/hacker/hackx.html-ssi) .

I'll answer a lot of questions that people have of me, provided I have time
and as long as it's not expected that I'm going to give definitive answers.
Again, I emphasize, I'm not an expert on hackers. But I'm not going to help
somebody in their quest to cause havoc on innocent internet users.

### Am I making a big deal out of nothing?

[

The Nymserver](http://www.nymserver.com/) used to be a free service that was
open to anybody in the world--now it's not free, because had to be severely
curtailed because of abuse. Or see how [another
service](http://www.netcreations.com/fakemail/index.html) had to shut down
because of abuse. Where is the glamour in destroying something just to be
destroying something? Where is the technical accomplishment? When somebody
works hard to provide something to people, and some jerks decide to screw it
up..... well, am I making too big a deal out of it? I don't think so. But you
decide for yourself whether the malicious jerks who cause such problems are
"cool." I think they are assholes.

### Feedback from "hackers"

When I started this part of my my website, I didn't know that the feedback
would be so quick. You can see [some of the feedback
here.](hfeed.htm)&nbsp_place_holder; It's a real eye-opener, and says much
about the type of people these are.

**Update July 17, 1999 -** What is it with the people who send me email telling me that I'm totally wrong, that hackers are doing the world a lot of good, that they don't screw with people, and then threaten me if I don't take down my webpage? &nbsp_place_holder; This is _good for the world?_&nbsp_place_holder; It sounds like losers and would-be-dictators to me.

### Other sources

This page started as a simple essay where I give my opinion and express my
disgust at a certain type of people. More and more, though, I'm being asked
for more information and background. To take care of those requests, here are
some other links you can follow if you are interested in this subject. I don't
necessarily endorse any of them or condem any of them. I'm just giving some
interesting sites that I've run across which you can view if you want more
information. Be aware that I'm finding these links by ordinary web searching,
like you and anybody else can do. That's all.
