<h3>Introduction</h3>

  

<i>"Cyberspace: A common mental geography, built, in turn by consensus and  

revolution, canon and experiment; a territory swarming with data and lies,  

with mind stuff and memories of nature, with a million voices and two million  

eyes in a silent, invisible concert of enquiry, deal-making, dream sharing and  

simple beholding."  </i><p>

"Cyberspace", a term coined by William Gibson in his novel Neuromancer  

(1984), has been used to describe the new, imaginary places where humans  

communicate, made possible by recent technological developments in CMC.  

Cyberspace is constituted by a global computer network called the Internet.  

Like other communications technologies before ( telegraph, telephone,  

television, etc ( the new array of communications technologies which  

constitute cyberspace have immense consequences for human interaction.  

This thesis explores one dimension of these consequences ( the formation of  

interpersonal ties ( in one type of CMC: Internet Relay Chat (IRC), a multi- 

user, real-time program. The emergence of these new sites for human  

communication provides space for 'cyberfusion' ( the development of human  

relationships in cyberspace.  <p>

  

The Internet began originally as ARPANET, a computer network set up by  

the United States Advanced Research Projects Agency, an arm of the United  

States Department of Defence. The network linked two universities in the  

United States in a bid to facilitate research and communication. Over time  

more educational institutions joined the network. In 1983 ARPANET was  

split into two networks: ARPANET for research and MILNET for military  

use. The research arm grew even further, adding government and commercial  

groups to the network. With the advent of satellite communications, similar  

networks all over the world were linked, forming the Internet (Reid, 1991).  

Now, in 1994, there are over 20 million users connected to the Internet around  

the world (The Australian, 14 June, 1994).  <p>

  

Users of the Internet can communicate in a variety of ways: electronic mail  

(email), usenet or network news, talk, Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs), and  

IRC. IRC, which is the focus of this thesis, was a program developed by  

Jakko Oikarinen in 1988 which enabled many users to communicate with  

each other at once in real-time, something not possible with existing  

programs. Within IRC there are channels which act like rooms in which  

discussions take place. These channels (both public and private) are necessary  

to divide the 5000 plus users that are on IRC at any one time. Anyone can  

join a public channel to participate in the discussion, however private  

messages can also be exchanged  between  two  users  which  are  unavailable   

to  anyone  else  (Poon, 1993, p 65-67).   <p>

  

The potential of the Internet is such that it allows the rapid exchange of  

information between people all over the world. It is frequently argued that the  

Internet, more than any other medium, makes possible free, open and equal  

access to information. If kept free from government regulation and  

censorship, this will facilitate steps to greater global 'democracy'. This belief is  

best seen in the writings of Kapor (1993, 1994) from the Electronic Frontiers  

Foundation which is actively working to keep the Internet an open system.  <p>

  

The Internet also allows communication between people who would not  

previously have been in contact. People from all around the world, it is  

claimed, have the opportunity to engage in conversation and form  

relationships without the barriers of ethnicity, nationality, class, religion,  

gender and age, enhancing the possibility of global 'community'. (Rheingold,  

1994; Reid, 1991, 1993)   <p>

  

Grand claims for the democratic and communal potential of the Internet are,  

however, often made without recourse to a detailed analysis of the new forms  

of interpersonal communication that came about with forms of CMC such as  

IRC. All communication on the Internet, for example, is textual and the  

people communicating are invisible to each other. This means that  

communication is very different to that which takes place on a FTF level. The  

implications of this are such that the ways in which people communicate,  

relate to each other and fuse together in relationships are altered. While these  

implications have been investigated on a larger scale, looking at issues of  

community (Rheingold, 1994), the same implications must be looked at on an  

interpersonal level.  <p>

  

New technologies which have the potential to reshape communication are,  

nevertheless, always introduced into social contexts with existing forms of  

human relationships, values and meanings. This thesis seeks to explore the  

ways this medium of communication alters the way people communicate,  

and yet also how it is that relationship formation in this medium on an  

interpersonal level reproduces aspects of FTF communication by users  

adapting the medium to their needs. The users of IRC in this adaptation  

develop and maintain the many types of relationships that are present in FTF  

communication from enemies to friends to lovers.  <p>

  

A social interaction perspective will be adopted to look at interpersonal  

relationships, using theories that address the formation of relationships and  

their subsequent development. In particular, social penetration theory  

developed by Altman and Taylor (1973) and an attraction theory developed  

by Levinger and Snoek (1972) will be used in conjunction with one another to  

understand the process of relationship formation. The literature surrounding  

CMC will also be investigated to understand the impact that this type of  

communication has had. In particular, social presence theory, developed by  

Short, Williams and Christie (1976), will be used to account for the changes  

brought about by the medium of communication.   <p>

  

In chapter one, the two areas of relationship formation and CMC will be  

outlined. This will be followed by a critical analysis of the three theories  

which when merged will form a suitable framework and method for the  

investigation of relationship formation on IRC. In this merger, three major  

issues emerge which will be discussed in the following chapters. Chapter two  

argues that while the medium alters the ways and contexts of communication,  

users of IRC have developed adaptations of verbal and Nonverbal  

Communication (NVC) as well as creating a new context in which to  

communicate. Once the means of communication has been established,  

chapter three will outline the problem of 'self' inherent in the two relationship  

formation theories by pointing to the dramaturgical theory by Goffman  

(1969) and the social selves theory as presented by Burkitt (1991) to best  

account for the problems of presenting and perceiving an accurate  

understanding of the self on IRC. In arguing for a social understanding of the  

self, it will be seen how issues of power and gender are important in the  

investigation of relationship formation.  <p>

  

It is hoped that through this discussion, a better understanding of how  

relationships form in a computer mediated environment will be obtained.  <p>
