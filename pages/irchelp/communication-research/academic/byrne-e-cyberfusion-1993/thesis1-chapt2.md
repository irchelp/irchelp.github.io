<h2>Chapter 2 : CyberTalk</h2>

  

When communicating with someone FTF, there are a number of aspects to  

that communication. Social penetration theory argues that there are three  

aspects to this: verbal behaviour, nonverbal use of the body and use of the  

physical environment. Without these aspects of communication the formation  

of relationships would not be possible. However, social presence theory  

indicates that there is a difference when using CMC as the communicants are  

invisible to each other and text on the computer screen is the only  

information given. As a result of this, communication is not available in the  

same way as it is FTF and if relationships are to be formed using CMC, users  

must adapt the medium to reproduce verbal, nonverbal and environmental  

aspects of communication.   <p>

  

In this chapter it will be shown how the users of IRC have in fact adapted the  

medium so that the formation of relationships can take place developing new  

forms of expression to compensate for the lack of physical presence. This will  

be done by investigating, first, the use of verbal and NVC on IRC, and  

secondly, the 'physical environment' of IRC.  <p>

  

<h3>A. Verbal and Nonverbal Communication  </h3>

  

Verbal and NVC are vital to the forming of interpersonal relationships on a  

FTF level. Verbal communication consists of words and sentences, while  

NVC is obtained from the physical movements of another person during a  

conversation. For the purposes of this thesis, verbal refers to communication  

using words generally, including written text. NVC on IRC is also textual but  

involves the manipulation of keyboard commands and symbols.  <p>

  

According to Forgas (1989), verbal communication is "the messages sent  

using words and sentences", whereas NVCs "support, modify or even  

completely replace the verbal message  consisting  of  eye  gaze,  smiles,   

gestures,  postural  changes, and  so  on." (p 137) Forgas goes on to argue that  

NVC is not simply another alternative to using language, but has very  

different characteristics to language. He says that there are three ways in  

which NVC differs from verbal communication. First, NVC is "much more  

immediate and automatic" (p 140) and so takes less time to decode than do  

verbal messages. A whole sentence takes longer to understand, interpret and  

to prepare a reply to than simply smiling at a friend. Secondly, NVC is often  

less subject to conscious interpretation and monitoring than is the case with  

language. As a result, nonverbal cues may often give a speaker away,  

revealing attitudes, feelings and emotions which they may not want to reveal.  

This is known as nonverbal leakage. Thirdly, NVC tends to be much more  

efficient in transmitting information about attitudes and emotions. For  

example, a smiling friend who runs over to hug someone expresses their joy  

in being able to see that person with a simple gesture rather than having to  

express this emotion in words. Forgas (1989) concludes that the consequence  

of these differences is that "language is primarily suited to conveying  

information about the external world, tasks to be solved and the like " while  

NVC plays " a particularly important role in social life, communicating  

values, attitudes, liking, and other personal reactions." (p 141)  <p>

  

The combination of verbal and NVC, then, provides a complementary  

richness in the expression of information and emotions in the formation of  

relationships. However, on IRC, this communication cannot take place in the  

same way as there is no physical person that can be seen. Hence, to convey a  

communicative richness, both verbal and NVC appear as text on the screen. It  

has therefore been argued that because communication is never spoken on  

IRC, all communication is therefore nonverbal. Yet, it appears that written  

text does contain elements of both verbal and NVC. While verbal  

communication appears as the written sentences, NVC is seen textually in the  

use of bold, underlining, italics, etc, which act in the same way as someone  

saying something loudly to attract attention (Daniels and Spiker, 1991).  <p>

  

Users of IRC have recognised the importance of both verbal and NVC in  

forming relationships and so have adapted the medium to allow them to  

distinguish between the two. This is achieved by representing verbal  

communication in the form of sentences while NVC is characterised in three  

ways: a) the manipulation of keyboard symbols to create 'emoticons' (iconic  

representations of emotions), b) a combination of IRC commands  and   

words  known  as  'actions'  (eg,  *hug*  to  indicate  hugging),  and c) 'textual  

markers' (changes in spelling and the use of underlining, bold, exclamation  

marks, etc).  <p>

  

<h4>a) Emoticons  </h4>

  

Emoticons involve the manipulation of keyboard symbols to form facial  

expressions. Their use is varied and there are an endless amount of  

combinations. Some examples of these are as follows (for the best effect they  

should be viewed side on):  <p>

<pre>  

:-) or :) a smiling face (known as smilies)  

:-( or :( a sad face   

:'-( a person crying   

;-) a wink  

*8) a person wearing glasses with funny hair   

=) a person with squinting eyes  

</pre><p>

The use of these emoticons are quite frequent in the flow of conversation and  

are used to convey humour, sarcasm, happiness, sadness, anger, confusion,  

etc. They are also used quite often in conjunction with the other forms of  

NVC. The following log is an example of the use of emoticons and other  

NVC in a typical enthusiastic greeting as people who are known join  

#Aussies:  <p>

<pre>  

[metta] mikey :)  

* hari thumps richard and steals the choccy MINE MINE MINE  

[Wiccan] hey hari.  

[hari] hi lisabeth :-) *lick*  

[hari] hi metta *lick*  

[hari] hi tz *puke* :-))))  

*** McAdder ... has joined channel #aussies  

* SmogNut huggles her bertie  

[SmogNut] (:  

[tz] adderyone  

[Wiccan] McAdder! :) hey.  

[McAdder] hey els :)  

[GrayElf] Hey Mc! :-)  

[Lisabeth] mcadder!!!!!!  

[McAdder] tz, wiccan :) paul, l' :))  

</pre><p>  

As can been seen, the use of emoticons is quite frequent. If the smilies were  

not present, many of the statements made in the above log may have  

appeared impersonal or been misunderstood. Their use is considered quite  

important for conveying meaning especially as much of the conversation is casual 

and informal and attempts to simulate conversation on a FTF level as far as possible. 

One interviewee reflected upon this:  <p>

  

M: <i>you can change the whole meaning of something with a smiley.  </i><br>

Elisabeth: <i>I tend to forget to put a smiley on the end of my sentences and  

when that happens it sounds really cold. </i><br> 

M: <i>some times I'll say things that have a time period between the sentence  

and the smiley, so they think about what I have said and then the smiley will  

come and they'll understand. People also do that in real life with sarcasm.  </i><p>

  

<h3>b) Actions  </h3>

  

Actions are a way of expressing a particular nonverbal event without actually  

describing it. While the person has to actually say that they are doing  

something, a new convention has been created which indicates a particular  

word construction is an 'action' rather than describing that action.  <p>

  

These actions take two forms. One form is accomplished by writing the action  

in asterisks such as *hug*, *smile*, *cry*, *nod*, *yawn*, *sneeze*, etc.  

The second form uses the action command itself which involves typing "/me"  

followed by a string of text. For example, a person with the nick (nickname)  

Fred may type "/me scratches his nose" which when sent to a channel will  

look like "*Fred scratches his nose". The following log shows how these  

actions are used:   <p>

<pre>  

* SmogNut throws pebbles at everyone  

[SmogNut] *toink*  

[SmogNut] *toink*  

[Lisabeth] everyone has gone suddenly quiet  

* muz threatens elsie with a live bunsen burner  

[Lisabeth] you can hear a pin drop... or pebble rather  

* Bram grabs the pebble and eats it *crunch*  

[SmogNut] is it on a safety flame, muz? (:  

* Lisabeth picks up the pebbles and throws them back  

* SmogNut ducks  

</pre><p>  

  

<h3>c) Textual Markers  </h3>

  

The textual markers of NVC on IRC are found in the use of non-conventional  

spelling and the use of bold, underlining and exclamation marks. These  

elements serve to mimic speech patterns and features not always available in  

written words.  <p>

  

Unconventional spelling is often used on IRC to reproduce the way words  

sound in speech instead of complying with the conventions of written  

spelling. This element may help to convey a characteristic way of speaking of  

a particular person that would not be known about unless heard. It is also  

used to reflect the informal and often jovial nature of conversation on IRC.  

Words that are commonly changed include: enough = enuf, you = u, what =  

wot, because = coz, want to = wanna, don't know = dunno, etc.  <p>

  

The use of bold, underlining, exclamation marks and capitals serve as they do  

in other written forms, to emphasise particular words and phrases and to  

indicate tone. There are commands which will highlight a particular word and  

exclamation marks work in a similar way to their conventional use in writing  

but are sometimes over used for added emphasis. It is not possible to  

underline something on IRC so instead words are emphasised by adding one  

underline before and after the word or phrase, eg, _both_. The use of capitals  

on IRC indicates that someone is shouting, eg:  <p>

<pre>  

[IronEagle] I HATE EDNA, EDNA IS A BITCH..........OF A MACHINE  

[IronEagle] I HAVE BUT ONE QUESTION.........WHY?  

</pre><p> 

   

The problem with substituting textual forms for NVC is that it becomes  

conscious and highly constructed. In FTF communication, NVC is, as Forgas  

(1989) argues, more immediate and unconscious. Most of the time we are  

unaware of our body movements or our facial expressions and so they are  

more likely to reflect feelings that are not expressed in words. This factor  

alone makes it more difficult to tell what a person is feeling or thinking on  

IRC. This is something that IRC users are aware of:  <p>

  

M: <i>Its not unconscious. I am sitting here wiggling my feet around. I know I  

wiggle my feet around when I think and I didn't know about that until I  

started going out with Ginnie ; I might scratch or stretch or yawn or take off  

my clothes and run around naked. You can't make up for that on IRC ; I  

think it is another thing that goes with using IRC for a while. Very often I will  

cough and most likely I'll type that in, just *cough* or *yawn* and people  

will ask me if I am bored and I'll say, "no, I'm just yawning", it has no  

underlying meaning to anything else on the channel ; It is conscious though.  

I mean I have been using IRC for 4 years and I don't subconsciously type  

stuff, even my yawns are conscious, I have to type them in.</i><p>  

  

NVC is also used in FTF communication to validate statements. It is often  

thought to show the truth in something someone says. On IRC it becomes  

much easier to use an appropriate emoticon to validate a statement even  

though the truth may not being told. Given this potential, IRC relationships  

involve more trust in what someone is saying is true as there is no  

unconscious NVC that can be used to suggest otherwise. This is something  

that many users of IRC worry about when attempting to form relationships  

and was reflected in comments from the survey:  <p>

  

They are not tangible coz I need something physical to see when I talk to  

someone. It helps me determine what is true and what is not. Body language  

is SO important in the way people perceive others and without that tone of  

voice a relationship is difficult to solidify.  <p>

  

This point was also brought up in the interviews:  <p>

  

B:<i>Talking to her on IRC you don't really know what she is doing or thinking.  

So like on IRC there was always this bit of paranoia, that she didn't like me  

and all that. But comparing that to being with her, you could here her voice,  

see her smile, you could hear her smile; brought on a bit more confidence that  

she liked me and appreciated me.  </i><br>

Elisabeth:<i> So you think that nonverbal is still important?  </i><br>

B:<i> Yeah, not just words, like a head shake or nod. You don't actually have to  

say those things to know they are happening.  </i><p>

  

Nevertheless, these technologies provide a communicative richness regarding  

emotions, tone and so on which compensates for the absence of physical  

presence and NVC on IRC.  <p>

  

It is obvious that users of IRC recognised the need for both verbal and NVC  

for the formation of their relationships and so adapted the medium to allow  

for both to occur. This form of communication has become an agreed  

convention for users of IRC, however, agreement is also needed for a key  

aspect of communication ( context.  <p>

  

<h3>B. Context   </h3>

  

The physical environment also plays an important role in the formation of  

FTF relationships. Altman and Taylor (1973) define physical environment as  

the use of physical areas and objects and the manipulation of space between  

people. Physical areas and objects provide a context for relationship  

formation, providing information about the other person and appropriate  

behaviour for that situation. The manipulation of personal space between  

people, for example, provides information about the relationship. Such space  

is thought to decrease as intimacy increases (Altman &  Taylor, 1973). The  

physical environment is also of importance to Levinger and Snoek (1972)  

who argue that people in close physical proximity are more likely to form  

relationships. Being geographically close to others provides increased  

opportunities to become aware of and develop relationships with them.  <p>

  

However, on IRC there is no physical environment in which people meet to  

communicate and for that reason could be considered 'contextless'. As users  

are not in each others' physical presence, there are no areas, objects or  

personal space from which to become aware of others or gain conversation  

cues. Yet IRC becomes the context for different types of relationships in two  

ways: a) through the recognition by users that IRC provides a common  

location for communication, and b) by the creation of channels.   <p>

  

<h3>a) Common Location  </h3>

  

With no common area in which to meet, IRC itself becomes the context. IRC,  

while not a physical area, provides a "virtual" space or location for  

communication, hence the use of terms such as cyberspace. However, it is  

only through an "imagined shared context"  (Rheingold, 1994, p 176) that  

users can have such a context. Stone (1991) points out that the use of CMC  

has brought about a new mode of interpersonal interaction and "a new  

manifestation of a social space that has been better known in its older and  

more familiar forms in conference calls,  letters, and  fireside chats. It can  

be characterised as 'virtual' space - an imaginary locus of interaction created  

by communal agreement." (pp 83-84) While the context created is a common  

space or location, the context is also "a cognitive and social one" (Rheingold,  

1994, p 61) in which contextual meaning for the formation of relationships is  

found: "It's like having the corner bar, complete with old buddies and  

delightful newcomers and new tools waiting to take home and fresh graffiti  

and letters, except instead of putting on my coat, shutting down the  

computer, and walking down to the corner, I just invoke my telecom program  

and there they are. It's a place." (Rheingold, 1994, p 24)  <p>

  

Without a context, formation of relationships would be impossible. It seems  

that users of IRC have accepted the concept of 'virtual' space or cyberspace to  

provide the context for their communications.  This acceptance was found in  

the surveys and logs on IRC. One survey participant stated that "it is like a  

favourite coffee-house one drops in for a chat." In the following log it can be  

seen how the context becomes accepted to the point where it is no longer a  

conscious part of communication on IRC:  <p>

<pre>

*Mistic* we all come on IRC to talk to ppl  

*Mistic* no other reason ...  

*Lisabeth* thats true, how then do we etablish relationships... we have to  

have some sort of overall setting that enables us to communicate ...  

*Mistic* like hmmm  

*Mistic* ya just tlak to ppl cause you can i think  

*Mistic* and you don't need an introduction  

*Mistic* there is no hesitation...  

*Mistic* like all that stuff is discarded when you IRC..  

*Lisabeth* ok, is it because as a group of people, all users of IRC agree that it  

is a place to talk, that there are no boundaries and you can talk to or reject  

people ...  

*Mistic* yeah ...  

*Lisabeth* so IRC becomes a "place" or a location like you would when you  

go to a party for instnace ...  

*Mistic* yeah  

*Mistic* IRC as a whole..  

</pre><p>  

With acceptance of IRC as being a virtual environment, there are certain  

characteristics of this environment which affect communication and the  

formation of relationships. Such a characteristic is time. On IRC it takes  

longer to communicate with someone than it would on a FTF level as text  

must be typed, sent to another person, read by that other person and a reply  

typed and returned. Often there will be added time lag between the sending of  

messages and the receiving of them because the connection is slow or the  

communications system is overloaded. This would indicate that it takes much  

longer to reach comparable stages in the formation of a relationship on IRC  

than it does FTF. Users of IRC wishing to form a relationship will need to  

have a certain amount of patience. As one interviewee said:  <p>

  

A:<i> Just as easy as it is to make relationships, it is just as easy to break them as  

well. Just because of one simple word that is lacking in most ppl on the net:  

patience. They might express, "oh, look, you can send email around the world  

in less than ten seconds", or however quick it is, and if you mail someone,  

and if they don't mail you back, you might think that there is something  

wrong here and they start to panic and stuff. And it happens because they  

don't have patience.  </i><p>

  

Communication does take longer on IRC and as a consequence relationships  

would require more time to progress through conventional stages of  

development. However, a result of this aspect of the medium is that a  

relationship may progress to intimate levels more quickly, bypassing the more  

physical dimensions of small talk. When talking on IRC finding out about  

people is the prime focus. In a FTF context people talk about their  

surroundings, the weather, and so on, to avoid talking about themselves.  

People also go to the movies or somewhere which becomes the basis of a  

conversation. Yet, on IRC, with no physical environment to talk about, the  

crossroads of a relationship may be reached rather quickly. One participant of  

the survey noted the rapid development and decline of relationships on IRC:   <p>

  

IRC relationships come and go alot easier they tend to be more 'passionate' or  

'exciting' but then tend to fade away just as fast.	  <p>

  

With the obvious frustration that some people experience when trying to  

communicate with friends on IRC, some users will resort to other forms of  

communication to explore their relationships further. When users were asked  

in the survey whether their IRC relationships had gone beyond  

communication on IRC, every participant had. The most common forms of  

additional communication were the exchange of photos (either on-line or  

through the post), writing letters, phone calls, and 'real life' meetings.   <p>

  

In other words, for many IRC users, communication on IRC is inserted into  

'traditional' means of communication in relationship formation.  <p>

  

<h3>b) Channels  </h3>

  

Social demographic similarity is one factor that brings together people to form  

relationships. It is more likely that someone will notice and come across  

people who are of the same, ethnicity, religion, status or occupation as their  

own (Levinger &  Snoek, 1972). These demographics often provide social  

contexts for communication. On IRC, the creation of channels also serves as  

social contexts, often forming around demographic similarities.  <p>

  

Channels are public areas which people can enter to talk with a group of  

people. Joining a channel is similar to walking down a corridor with many  

doors on either side and picking one door to enter. Walking through one of  

these doorways is like walking into a room. Inside these rooms there maybe  

many people or just one or two. Channels have names, and it is usually the  

name that will influence someone to join it. These names indicate either a  

demographic, topic of conversation or the name of the person who started the  

channel. Channels therefore serve to bring people with similar demographics  

into contact so that they can form relationships.  <p>

  

There are a wide range of demographics which are reflected in IRC channels.  

There are many channels for people with computer interests such as #linux,  

#mac, #dos, etc which are a result of a majority of people on IRC being male  

university students who study some form of computing or graduates working  

in the computer industry. These channels therefore reflect a similar  

occupation or status. Channels such as #Islam, #Wicca, #Christian, etc, bring  

people of the same religion or spirituality together. There are also channels  

that refer to nationality such as #Aussies, #Canada, #Taiwan, etc.  <p>

  

Channels also form around similar interests. #BDSM (Bondage, discipline,  

sadism and masochism) allows people who are involved in that sort of  

behaviour, or just curious about it to communicate. #NBA allows people who  

are interested in basketball to come into contact. When asked about this factor  

on IRC, one user responded:  <p>

<pre>  

[Pax] ... #'s are the communication...ppl gather at their interests  

</pre><p>  

While the channels bring together people with common interests, they also  

serve to bring people together who may never have come into contact  

otherwise. As one survey participant said, "I find that many interesting chats  

take place with people from ethnic, national, or age groups that I would not  

usually be in touch with."  <p>

  

There are also channels created on IRC that have no bearing at all on  

demographic characteristics. Some are merely formed for the purposed of  

chatting with others, eg, #chat, #talk, etc. While this may not seem to provide  

a context, Rheingold (1994) says that "idle talk _is_ context-setting. Idle talk  

is where people learn what kind of person you are, why you should be trusted  

or mistrusted, what interests you." (p 60) Idle talk is only seen to be  

contextless when viewed from a task-related perspective. If it is viewed in the  

context of forming relationships, idle talk is not pointless, but the point of  

communication.   <p>

  

With a common space and social context for communication, IRC users have  

the means to form relationships and find out about other people. However,  

finding out what "kind of person you are" is a far more complex phenomenon  

than may first be thought. This will be discussed in the following chapter.  <p>
