    Yup. It's BSD. Various flavours of BSD operating systems are the main topic on this network, 
    pretty much in the same style as on LinuxNET. A network for the experts.
    Rather unfriendly towards outsiders, all they lack is a 'Keep Out' notice
    in the MOTD. If you don't know what BSD is, this is not for you.<br>
