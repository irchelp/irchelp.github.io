# mIRC Exploit News

Ed. Note: This page is maintained for historical reasons only. The current
version of mIRC (6.2 as of Oct 2006) has no known exploits. You are encouraged
to upgrade to this version if you haven't already.

## Do not click on Britney.jpg

This is not a mIRC bug, but it is an exploit that affects users of Windows IRC
clients. Do not click on any URL that ends in Britney.JPG! A worm (self-
propagating virus) is going around that spams IRC channels with a URL of an
alleged Britney Spears picture. Do not click on that URL, it contains an
Internet Explorer / Windows Media Player exploit. For more info see this
[page](http://charmy.tky.hut.fi/brit.txt) (ext. link). In fact, in general you
should never click on URLs that come up in unsolicited messages.

## DCC Exploit Affecting 6.12

On Oct 20 2003, another exploit was identified which can crash even the
recently released version 6.12. It only seems to affect people who minimize
DCC get dialog windows (manually or by default), and then open those windows
to get a file with an excessively long filename. You can't be crashed unless
that sequence of events occurs. That manual step is required. If you auto-get
the file, or don't get the file at all, nothing happens.

If and only if you think the above affects you, then here is a temporary fix
which should be pasted in your "remotes" section (alt-r to access). It
basically rejects any excessively long filename.

`ctcp *:dcc send:*: if ($len($nopath($filename)) >= 225) { echo 4 -s $nick
tried to crash you with an illegal dcc send of $nopath($filename) | halt }`

or this shorter version without the warning message:

`ctcp *:dcc send:*: if ($len($nopath($filename)) >= 225) halt`

If you are not comfortable with modifying your remotes, you can just ignore
all incoming DCC sends with the following, which is the same temporary fix as
for the other bug described in the next section:

`/ignore -wd *`

You can undo the above command by `/ignore -rwd *` (note the r for remove).

## DCC Exploit Affecting 6.0-6.11

Starting Oct 12, 2003, an exploit was used to crash many people's mIRC
clients. All versions from 6.0 thru 6.11 were affected, [version
6.12](http://www.mirc.com/get.html) was released Oct 13 to fix the problem.
The exploit involves a DCC command which can be sent to any person or channel,
no matter what your DCC options are. (DCC is used to trade files or for DCC
chat.) Just download the new version to fix this problem.

Check EFnet #mIRC topic (use `/raw list #mIRC` if you cannot join) for updates
too. The information was contributed by EFnet helpers from many sources,
working together in harmony without ego or drama, who knew. It is not an
official message from the author of mIRC.
