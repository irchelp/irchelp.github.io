# UnderNet

[UnderNet](http://www.undernet.org) is one of the oldest IRC networks, and was one of the first major networks to offer channel registration.

## Services

UnderNet offers [account and channel registration](http://www.undernet.org/services.php). There is no nickname registration.

Channel registration on UnderNet is reserved for "established" channels, and follows a unique process - users wishing to register a channel must already hold the channel without the use of services for a period of time, must petition for registration via an application process, and must have 5 unique supporters (in addition to the applicant), who must be regulars of the channel and agree to the registration. Further, each person is limited to a single channel registration.

This unique process helps to insure that registered channels are active channels, with a solid base of users, rather than users finding channels they want and sit vacant have already been registered and are unavailable.

## Culture

UnderNet has a strong culture of welcoming users, with help channels, special events, news, informational classes and seminars, for the benefit of all users on the network.

UnderNet is a centrally governed network, with a comparatively bureaucratic structure, and many activities governed by various [committees](http://www.undernet.org/committees.php).
