# General IRC Networks

_Selected networks with several hundred to several thousand users_

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

updated {{ site.data.netlist.property.lastchange }}

This page is part of the [IRChelp.org Networks Site](/networks/), please do not mirror or distribute.

We've set up separate pages to highlight some of the [most popular](popular.html) 
nets (with over 10,000 people), or those serving a
special [local region](/networks/regional.html) or 
[topical area](/networks/topical.html). That still leaves hundreds of general
networks. If you really want a full list, check out the
[netsplit.de](/networks/) 3rd party statistics site [ext. link]. We highlight
just a few of these small to medium networks below. They are not necessarily
the best or biggest nets. We just want to give you some suggestions if you're
new to IRC and looking for a general chat network. If you're fed up with the
chaos of the [popular nets](popular.html), many of these nets have full
services and can be a reasonable place for you to either start or move your
channel. Networks are listed alphabetically.
