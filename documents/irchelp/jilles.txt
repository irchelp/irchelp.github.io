483696:<jilles> perhaps this will help: ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/tools/, get bootinst.exe and boot.bin
484003:<jilles> calc is correct too
484009:<jilles> yes, but you need parentheses for that
484011:<jilles> because -x^y = -(x^y)
484012:<jilles> so (if x and y are greater than zero) is always negative

485637:<ShadowDog> 'lo jilles
485638:<jilles> hi ShadowDog
485715:<jilles> hmm, wrong IRC network? there are no nickname/channel registration services on efnet ;-)
486063:<jilles> what are you looking for?
486105:<jilles> spooky-, using a NAT device (thing for connecting multiple computers on your Internet connection)
486106:<jilles> ?
486110:<jilles> could still be a NAT device that must be configured to forward the port
486113:<jilles> when you ask your computer to show the IP on its network interface, it is different from your outside IP
486114:<jilles> usually, it's of the form 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x
486117:<jilles> when I attempt to connect to your port 113 from my home connection, it times out
486119:<jilles> if I try other ports such as 23 or 114, I get connection refused
486122:<jilles> check with netstat -an if it's open on the local pc
486125:<jilles> make sure it's enabled in mirc
486128:<jilles> I've never used mirc
486131:<jilles> perhaps the setting only takes effect when you restart mirc?
486135:<jilles> probably won't help then
486143:<jilles> could be
486145:<jilles> I don't know, but you can try
486153:<jilles> spooky-, you could try asking in a mirc-specific channel
486378:<jilles> the server will send its public key + certificate if necessary
486381:<jilles> scripts.irssi.org
486382:<jilles> I use only four scripts (strictly speaking): nickserv screen_away autoopper ho_reformat
486385:<jilles> I also have a small collection of sometimes complicated aliases
486388:<jilles> the ho_reformat I have is perhaps an older version; I had to modify it a bit to prevent it from mangling server notices to channels (channel X TS changed...)
486390:<NotTriona> jilles: I'd venture to guess theres an updated one.
486392:<jilles> when I got it, the ho_reformat was not yet part of the "new-style collection"
486393:<jilles> I guess I should check for a new version some day ;-)
486400:<jilles> /help connect,   -ssl_cert: The SSL client certificate file (implies -ssl)   etc
486422:<jilles> I see no such setting
486442:<jilles> I use query windows although many people say it's stupid
486443:<jilles> for services (non-efnet obviously) I put several queries in one window (/wquery)
486449:<jilles> for multinetwork there is the choice between one irssi with everything and one irssi instance per network
486465:<jilles> "hi-power antennae" are mostly effective because they're directed
486467:<jilles> more power will have to come from the transmitter :p
486476:<jilles> what's sent to the window
486478:<jilles> ends all up in window 1 by default
486486:<jilles> perhaps window 1's level is messed up
487019:<jilles> the movie industry has a better "timing scheme" (i.e. pay thrice for the same movie)

487997:<jilles> because of the abuse associated with them
488045:<jilles> you should put the clients on different servers and do some magic (sounds easier than it is) to make their idents different
488048:<Jolo> what jilles said
488049:<sheh2> jilles: Ident is off for one of them.
488064:<jilles> not so easily if you're both +i and all in different +s channels
488140:<jilles> not for this kind of stuff
488150:<jilles> it can get slightly nasty with web forums
488152:<Jolo> jilles: right, i suppose i could call somebody a nasty name :)
488155:<jilles> sometimes it happens people are banned from web forums and use proxies to access them anyway
488160:<Jolo> jilles: right, which is yet another reason the proxies are quickly blocked
488169:<jilles> Jolo, http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/misc/umodes.html? that's somewhat out of date too ;-)
488187:<Jupiter> jilles that  http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/misc/umodes.html? is interesting. thanks for posting that url :-)
488200:<jilles> efnet +w should be marked as oper-only
488203:<jilles> while most efnet ircds allow any user to set +s or +w, it doesn't actually do anything
488208:<jilles> hybrid 7 doesn't
488210:<Jolo> jilles: hmm, interesting
488225:<jilles> ratbox 2.0.x /quote help umode has umode          +g     - "caller id" mode only allow accept clients to message you
488229:<Jupiter> yah, jilles, that is the one i saw
488289:<jilles> there are +C and +Z, oper-only umodes on ratbox servers
488291:<Jolo> jilles: explain? all new to me
488294:<jilles> +Z is show operspy notices
488297:<jilles> +C is similar to +c except it's a format easier machine-parsable and shows the two unused fields in USER
488300:<jilles> yes
488304:<jilles> umode +C is new in ratbox 2.0 btw
488308:<jilles> both a fair amount
488317:<jilles> there appear some more oper-only umodes missing, older ones
488318:<jilles> umode +l is an older oper-only umode, show LOCOPS messages (hybrid 7 has this too, no idea about hybrid 6)
488319:<jilles> umode +a (server administrator)

489804:<jilles> if you're violating rules you're more likely to be caught if you're hated, I suppose
489817:<jilles> they're listed in a blacklist, probably because of open proxies
489818:<jilles> tell him to go to http://cbl.abuseat.org/
489891:<jilles> wait a minute between attempts
489893:<Jupiter> and what jilles said
489895:<jilles> and cycle between a list of servers
490049:<jilles> marco_, how so? do they keep evading or does the ban just "not work"?
490057:<jilles> check the ban exception list (/mode #sportsgambling e)
490058:<jilles> or it could be a desync as crptx suggests
490064:<jilles> /mode #sportsgambling -e <mask>
490090:<jilles> you get the names list before that
490096:<jilles> the first time the bots kickbanned you perhaps
490098:<jilles> and if you've been in there for some time you should know some ops
490099:<jilles> if you don't know any, it's not probable they'll do you a favour
490107:<jilles> yes, it is stupid but understandable in many cases; no, we can't do anything to help you
490108:<jilles> you can ask another user in the channel (not op)
490111:<jilles> or you can try to enter with chat.efnet.org but that could be considered ban evasion, beware
490114:<jilles> I doubt it's a good idea to use it in this case

493417:<jilles> they're not accessible without password?
493422:<jilles> if they're accessible without password or other protection ("open proxies") they're banned because of the resulting abuse

501244:<jilles> if you want a bot on your channel you'll have to run it yourself
501255:<jilles> you may want to run your channel on a network with services
501267:<jilles> if you'd run your bot on the same computer and connection you run your normal client on, there's not much point in it
501272:<jilles> do you have friends who do have that?
501276:<jilles> I can't help you with it
501278:<jilles> consider letting your channel disappear when the last user leaves
501279:<jilles> and when your chosen channel name is already in use if you come back, use another name
501280:<jilles> alternatively, move to a network with services
501282:<jilles> or don't run your own channel and chat on others' channels

513752:<jilles> depends on which ircd
513755:<jilles> in any case you can set up and link services; if there is a services package compatible with your ircd it should work ('operserv')
513757:<jilles> the rest depends on what you're running
513758:<jilles> /quote version
513762:<jilles> hmm, you can do it without services then but I don't know how
513765:<jilles> if you have high enough privs in your oline
513767:<jilles> and enabled the correct umode

514397:<jilles> I've seen that being flooded before in another chan
514398:<jilles> with colours that time so the bot kbed with a pretty scary message

514824:<jilles> see http://www.efnet.org/chanfix/

516210:<jilles> that was the plan earlier

516348:<Jupiter> what happened in #efnet, jilles?
516352:<jilles> Jupiter, they only said "FORE!"
516354:<jilles> until they were banned
516893:<jilles> hmm those stupid bots come here too, now
516930:<jilles> there's not much difference between sayign "moo" and saying "hi" or something like that, imho
516935:<jilles> well I'm seeing it a lot
517426:<jilles> /mode #channel b
517428:<jilles> that shows the ban list so you can see if you've been unbanned
517429:<jilles> it could be that the ban is removed but a bot will reset it if you attempt to join, though
517430:<jilles> on the other hand, many channels use bots which automatically remove all op-set channel bans after e.g. 1 or 2 hours
517435:<jilles> ops may ban for whatever reason they like

521969:<jilles> because it threatens the stability of the network or a server

522274:<jilles> only ones with certain flags
522300:<jilles> in most efnet ircds, any oper can jupe a channel
522304:<jilles> conf access is more access than oper access
522308:<jilles> /quote resv doesn't require any flags even

527480:<jilles> they want to be able to kick you off if the total b/w used in your environment is too high and you're among the top users
527482:<jilles> obviously that can happen even if you use relatively few b/w
527701:<jilles> the forced activation possibility is designed to reverse takeovers
527707:<jilles> afaik not and that is indeed unfortunate
527708:<jilles> I think it uses pretty crude heuristics that can fail
527711:<jilles> nope
527713:<jilles> it's not
527717:<jilles> the services.int code (which is the efnet chanfix) is available too but it's really ugly
527721:<jilles> that's services.int
527722:<logiclrd> jilles: right, so it's the closest thing to documentation about what efnet is currently using
527723:<jilles> there is a fair amount of documentation about chanfix targetted at users

527993:<jilles> meh
528354:<jilles> probably the issue of people mistakenly thinking that chanfix == chanserv which it isn't
528357:<jilles> chanfix oper privs can certainly be abused
528365:<jilles> that doesn't work, I think, for the takeover-fixing part
528366:<jilles> also allowing certain opers, but not all users, to see certain information about channels seems useful
528368:<jilles> knowing who has which scores could be very useful for someone planning a takeover 8)
528369:<Raccoon> jilles, agreed.  to many opers have that access.
528380:<jilles> the case where the oper or his friends are scored as well doesn't require special chanfix access
528381:<jilles> /kill'ing all ops will trigger chanfix
528383:<jilles> without chanfix, it'd be necessary to kill all users on the channel which is more conspicuous
528384:<jilles> instead of a kill, a tkline would probably be used if possible -- that's less conspicuous
528385:<jilles> remote tklines don't show up outside the server where they apply, while remote kills show up on all servers and www.efnet.org
528391:<jilles> JupaSaur, yes, I think the ability to stop almost all netsplit abuse is very useful
528393:<jilles> because if a netsplit can be useful some people will tend to cause them

529975:<jilles> probably not :)
530714:<jilles> there's some part of autorejoin on "Nick/channel not available"
530715:<jilles> /help rmrejoins
530716:<jilles> I don't know when it retries though
530721:<jilles> I can't find anything about it in /usr/local/share/doc/irssi/* though
530723:<jilles> so it could just be a half-baked feature
530732:<jilles> or retry them all (should be 1 or 2 lines at most)
530734:<jilles> JOIN usually still allows a 512-line worth of channel names
530755:<jilles> opers are exempt from no_create_on_split anyway ;p
530757:<jilles> but it's perhaps best to not use that as it could be seen as abuse
530759:<jilles> right
530762:<JupaSaur> jilles it easily coudl be seen as oper abuse if you would split in with ops and you are not a ch op
530763:<jilles> TS will avoid _that_
530764:<jilles> but you can also join through a +i or ban
530765:<jilles> and that would be abuse
530767:<jilles> that too
530770:<jilles> channel keys would require a real effort to abuse, probably
530771:<jilles> if you have the channel on autojoin, you probably have the correct key already
530779:<jilles> using bad splitmode detection?
530790:<jilles> most servers turn it off N seconds after the number of users and servers have passed certain thresholds
530792:<jilles> a recent ratbox released improved this by turning it off after getting eob for enough servers

535021:<jilles> danang, if you have something to ask, ask in the channel
535038:<jilles> yes

535050:<jilles> (which I cannot see because the server I use disables that)
535475:<jilles> not part of the regexp itself unless you count stuff like [Tt][Hh][Ii][Ss]

537336:<jilles> oh ok
537337:<jilles> could be the proxy scanner confusing the box although that's unlikely
537338:<jilles> or someone hates him and sends him an evil packet when he joins a certain channel

537346:<jilles> then I have no idea
537351:<jilles> see www.efnet.org/?module=servers
537422:<jilles> probably possible if it's some kind of scripting
537424:<jilles> can you do php or perl or the like?
537429:<jilles> some web servers automatically try index.php if index.html cannot be found
537430:<jilles> then you can put your code in index.php
537436:<jilles> to save resources it's probably best to only do the trick for the main page
537437:<jilles> keeping all sub-pages unique
537441:<jilles> don't know, sorry
537788:<jilles> your reverse dns may be half-broken
537790:<jilles> e.g. if it's very slow, it may happen that it times out for some servers and not for others
537791:<jilles> I could look up your hostname but it felt a bit slow
537809:<JupaSaur> the reason you get it one way or the other has to do with the "dns" to which jilles was referring
537811:<JupaSaur> sometimes the process by which that is done (called resolution) is broken as jilles told and you get the numeric ip instead of the alph-numeric ip. but it is not random
537839:<jilles> correct, you cannot register channels

548584:<jilles> you have not installed ident correctly
548591:<jilles> he uses mirc, that has an option for it
548596:<jilles> it seems either it's not enabled in mirc or elsewhere, or the forwarding is not set up correctly
548598:<jilles> that's an option if you can run some kind of identd on the gateway
548599:<jilles> but you can't on most appliances
548602:<jilles> that should work
548605:<jilles> mirc doesn't care about the port numbers in the identd request
548608:<jilles> one is enough
548616:<jilles> no, it shows the identd doesn't work
548682:<jilles> IP or IP range
548688:<jilles> hmm, I'm guessing you didn't get a /64 :P
548691:<jilles> you can try a different ipv6 provider
548693:<jilles> or get the provider to explain to the IRC server admins that each user only gets a /127 or so
548703:<jilles> he probably wants ipv6 for vanity reasons ;p
548705:<jilles> many servers just put 127.0.0.1 on Closing Link

549235:<jilles> you're banned
549240:<JupaSaur> jilles do you know how to change pine from white on black to black one white?
549241:<jilles> you're running it in xterm?
549242:<jilles> Data_sys, you surely know more than that if it's so recent
549251:<jilles> it is not an email address
549255:<JupaSaur> jilles whatever is the default terming in mandake 9.0
549257:<jilles> konsole has a menu item to change colour scheme
549258:<JupaSaur> jilles i have the settings for the term set to black on white. but when pine comes up, it switches to white on black
549261:<jilles> try xterm -fg black -bg white and start pine from that
549262:<jilles> Data_sys, there are other math channels
549263:<jilles> some that I know of are #m-a-t-h on efnet and #math on freenode

551485:<lil0ne-> hi jilles
551486:<JupaSaur> hi jilles
551524:<jilles> firewall/router is not configured for it
551557:<jilles> Most questions answered @ www.irchelp.org - else pls ask and wait 5-10 mins, we'll respond when we can
551576:<jilles> this network (efnet) does not have nick/channel registration services
551577:<jilles> see http://www.irchelp.org/noserv
551581:<jilles> as I said, you can't
552225:<jilles> what does that question mark do? ;-)
552231:<jilles> prysm, I know that, I was just wondering about ?* instead of *
552356:<jilles> often, that's a bug in bnc
552358:<jilles> it doesn't throttle itself enough
552437:<jilles> nope
552442:<jilles> it allows you to see server notices, kills and server wallops
552443:<jilles> but it lacks things like umode +g and topic bursting
552446:<jilles> /map is disabled for nonopers on almost all servers anyway
552448:<jilles> and hyb6 and hyb7.0 don't have /map either, usually
552457:<jilles> at least in stock ratbox with the stock contrib/*spy*.c, there's no +y notice on /map
552459:<jilles> flattened /links doesn't generate a notice either
552467:<jilles> Raccoon-, shows a linear list of servers which is updated ~ every 5 mins
552471:<jilles> also it blocks /stats v and /stats ? from lusers, and zeroes out the hop count in /who
552473:<jilles> efnet.xs4all.nl has it
552480:<jilles> yes
552481:<jilles> the order in which it lists them still discloses routing information though :P
552484:<jilles> many clients don't show the server name in /who
552488:<jilles> /whois <server> <nick> is also cool
552491:<jilles> kind of a "safe" /trace sometimes
552496:<jilles> remote whois shouldn't be scripted

558315:<jilles> don't mention IRC to them :)
558317:<jilles> they may be put off by that
558318:<jilles> I'd ask first why reverse dns doesn't work from outside
558321:<jilles> you probably can't avoid mentioning IRC for the identd thing, though
559099:<jilles> /userhost?
559415:<jilles> read topic
559417:<jilles> I don't do that, but you can read www.irchelp.org/download
559456:<jilles> that means that +n was set
559457:<jilles> which is a good idea: it prevents users outside the channel from sending to it
559460:<jilles> probably some misunderstanding between you and your client ;-)
559463:<jilles> www.irchelp.org has some good docs
559472:<jilles> hmm, actually I have a reasonable guess what went wrong
559473:<jilles> check that you're using the correct channel name and IRC network
559474:<jilles> :)
559476:<jilles> because servers tend to set +nt on new channels
559479:<JupaSaur> jilles TheBobste seems to be using snak and i have no idea how snak handles things like nick lists and mode stuff'
561031:<jilles> if it says "Illegal channel name" the channel is juped and you should *not* try again
561035:<jilles> because those channels cause trouble for the server (e.g. drones)
561038:<jilles> or because the server admin totally disagrees with the channel (e.g. #chanfix on a few servers)
561040:<jilles> or, just because
561047:<jilles> no
561124:<jilles> or find docs for the ircd they use
561130:<jilles> try /version
561132:<jilles> eh, better /quote version
561133:<jilles> or look at what it spews at you when connecting
561747:<jilles> for nicks, happens for 15 mins after that nick has quit from a netsplit
561749:<jilles> for channels, happens when you attempt to create a channel while the server is split
561751:<jilles> the server is not connected to enough other servers
561752:<jilles> you can check in /lusers how many users and servers there are in "your" part of the net
561753:<jilles> should be about 60 servers for efnet
561756:<jilles> you may have to wait 15-60 seconds after the netsplit before you may begin creating channels again
561757:<jilles> there've not been many netsplits recently, though

566640:<jilles> in case a server does not support CHW, some servers change it to a message to each op

566645:<lil0ne-> jilles is good
566649:<jilles> yup
566650:<jilles> it is likely that the problem I mentioned doesn't occur at all
566652:<jilles> ratbox just drops the message if CHW support is missing
566654:<jilles> and hyb6 converts all CHW to notice to @#channel anyway
566657:<jilles> there's also privmsg/notice to +#channel but many clients and servers don't support it properly

570751:<jilles> correct
571507:<jilles> use a web-based channel listing
571508:<jilles> www.irchelp.org and www.efnet.org have them
571540:<jilles> with eggdrops 1 or 2 hours is common
571541:<jilles> some channels may hardly expire bans at all
571543:<jilles> with a limit of 100 +beI modes, small channels don't have too much reason to remove old ones
571575:<jilles> join something that doesn't exist yet
571662:<jilles> you cannot
571663:<jilles> see www.irchelp.org/noserv
571723:<jilles> I don't think that much spam comes from hotmail, although it is used a lot to collect replies to spam
571725:<JupaSaur> how do you mean collect replies to spam, jilles?
571726:<jilles> listed in from or reply-to header
571728:<JupaSaur> so, what are you implying exaclty, jilles?
571729:<jilles> that you aren't clear what you want to block exactly :)
571730:<jilles> I suppose you want to block From: .*@hotmail.com, right?
571731:<jilles> but that has little relation to where the email actually comes from
571734:<jilles> spam usually arrives at benign mail servers from spammers' machines or from open proxies
571735:<jilles> web mail services rate limit by IP and user account, so I don't think they're very useful to send spam
571736:<jilles> (well it's very easy to rate limit, so I suppose they do it)
571765:<LapJup> jilles: so you are suggestin that the thing to key in on is the reply to address for spam and to block email that comes to you with hotmail as a reply to address
571766:<jilles> well that's what I interpreted your suggestion as

572970:<jilles> an irc network is a collection of one or more servers

574625:<jilles> that's kazaa, &c
574626:<jilles> ?
574630:<jilles> yup
574631:<jilles> but in what degree are efnet servers different from the ISPs that the traders use? ;-)
574680:<jilles> JupaSaur, you were kicked for saying lol
574681:<jilles> not for the other things you said
574685:<JupaSaur> thanks though, jilles

574688:<JupaSaur> but thanks though, jilles
574707:<jilles> s/does/does not/?
574710:<JupaSaur> yes jilles. s/does/does not/   thanks
574713:<jilles> and manual chanfix shouldn't be done on warez chans
574714:<jilles> nor any other kind of chanfix help from opers
574716:<JupaSaur> right jilles
574722:<jilles> if a channel is juped on US servers, it effectively doesn't exist there
574724:<JupaSaur> that might work, jilles
574729:<jilles> juping "all warez channels" is easier said than done
574734:<jilles> probably your point 6) is a better description
574735:<jilles> i.e. jupe it when seen
574737:<jilles> ShadowDog, point
574739:<jilles> that was researched for Stack years ago, and there it was concluded it was better not to moderate at all
574740:<jilles> but that's Dutch law, not US
574747:<jilles> and you can configure oomon such that it klines users trying to join warez chans right away
574748:<jilles> then it's harder to create new channels
574750:<jilles> and a new www.irchelp.org/download
574752:<JupaSaur> yes jilles
574753:<jilles> obviously
574759:<jilles> it's probably better to be prepared for this
574760:<jilles> rather than having to shut down servers because of court order at some unexpected point
574762:<JupaSaur> jilles yep and yep
574788:<jilles> yes
574803:<jilles> JupaSaur, looks like it
574806:<jilles> try #<name of country> or #<name of big city>
574813:<jilles> yah
574843:<jilles> afaik downloading warez is legal in some countries
574845:<jilles> uploading it is more dangerous
574877:<jilles> hehe
575088:<jilles> maildir is nicer for backups
575089:<jilles> but slower in reading all the headers
575090:<jilles> and it uses up inodes
575091:<jilles> and wasted parts of blocks/fragments
575094:<jilles> wmono, not tape blocks, typically
575097:<jilles> but if the mails are ~2k it's still pretty nasty
575099:<jilles> as BSD commonly uses 16k/2k blocks/fragments
575102:<jilles> so it's likely there are a lot of mails that use two fragments but only a small part of the second
575111:<jilles> fserves are more harmful
575113:<jilles> there the warez % is larger
575114:<wmono> jilles, but that doesn't show intent

577060:<JupaSaur> jilles are you here?
577572:<jilles> yes that's correct
577577:<jilles> or start another instance of the client if you don't want to disconnect from here
577817:<jilles> put the aliases in ~/.bashrc instead
577823:<jilles> aliases are not passed through
577828:<jilles> another option is to start login shells in your term
577829:<jilles> e.g. xterm -ls

578444:<jilles> everything you send can flood you off :p
578447:<jilles> irssi has checks in it that will prevent flooding off, provided there is no considerable network lag
578448:<jilles> but if there's lag no client can prevent flooding off, really
578450:<jilles> well you can but you can hardly send anything
578458:<jilles> because it only ever reacts to opers :p
578461:<jilles> you can't do anything yourself with chanfix
578465:<jilles> either it activates automatically or you have to ask an oper
578467:<jilles> note that not all opers have access to chanfix

580836:<jilles> java applets are good for that
580845:<jilles> TooCool, we put it on a separate box, too much complication to run it on each ircd
580847:<jilles> java applets do not help with firewall issues
580852:<jilles> but you don't need an applet for that :p
580892:<jilles> TooCool, I don't use that java stuff myself
580893:<jilles> but there are many, often fairly clueless, users that use it, so apparently it works ok
580897:<jilles> depends on what your target audience is
580899:<jilles> hmm
580900:<jilles> on one of the servers I admin there is a cgi:irc for that
580901:<jilles> but that network is really friendly so the abuse problem doesn't really exist
580904:<jilles> I'm not sure if it's up right now
580905:<jilles> besides, it's just a cgi:irc, not much special about it
580906:<jilles> we've restricted it to one server and two channels
580908:<jilles> I don't know really
580909:<jilles> cgi:irc uses a trick where it never finishes loading the page
580912:<jilles> the nice thing is that you don't have to make a new conn every time something is said
580917:<jilles> then you perhaps like a java applet more
580918:<jilles> those are fairly hard to find though
580922:<jilles> one of the channels I'm on where java applets are used uses gopjirc (that's free)
580923:<jilles> the other's web site is down at the moment so I can't check
581060:<jilles> DNS is usually served from a different box than the client (which you're irc'ing from)
581064:<Xenophon> jilles: Indeed.
581116:<jilles> wmono, no, an irssi thing
581118:<jilles> it's similar to mirc's /server -m
581216:<jilles> o
581218:<jilles> no
581226:<jilles> but more recent ratbox 2.x will store those two params and report it in +C and etrace
581227:<jilles> so you can (as an oper/admin) ban on it in oomon and the like
581234:<jilles> RuyDuck, rfc1459 allows both
581239:<jilles> actually rfc1459 recommends PASS, NICK, USER
581241:<jilles> but the only requirement is not sending PASS last
581275:<jilles> ch1c04n [~hypernayt@216.222.36.156]
581277:<ch1c04n> Sorry jilles, I don't understand.
581278:<jilles> that's your nick [user@host]
581279:<jilles> what's the ban mask that affects you?
581298:<jilles> "running as root" usually means you match *!*root@*
581299:<jilles> but you don't match that
581346:<jilles> identd is also still useful if the admin of the IRC server trusts the client's root more than the users on it
581352:<jilles> also makes it harder to evade a ban on username on multiuser boxes
581470:<jilles> as I see it, copyleft is just an application of copyright
581571:<jilles> www.irchelp.org/download and that's everything we can say about it
582132:<jilles> dalnet became much smaller
582135:<jilles> afaik the problem was that a very big server (20k+ clients) delinked
582136:<jilles> and the other servers couldn't handle the load
582179:<jilles> I think it was problematic even before that
582181:<jilles> e.g. the isreal vs arab issue

584503:<jilles> on efnet: +p prevents it appearing in whois and prevents knock to it
584504:<jilles> +s hides it from whois and list and prevents most queries from outside (topic, list, who, names)
584507:<jilles> Jolo, it's paranoid, really
584508:<jilles> there is one important caveat with this
584509:<jilles> there is some thing called ircd-w.concentric.net, it will not allow a channel to be set both +p and +s
584512:<jilles> so if you want +ps, first set +p then +s
584513:<jilles> that way it will be +s on the other side of that hub
584515:<jilles> afaik all other servers allow +ps
584516:<jilles> although the exact meaning can be slightly different
584523:<jilles> concentric isn't any kind of hybrid
584524:<Dianora> jilles: *really*
584528:<jilles> sorry
584534:<jilles> ratbox-services is pretty "original"
584535:<Dianora> jilles: no it is not

584541:<jilles> well I'm a bit confused
584546:<jilles> I've tried out some 7.1 betas
584548:<Dianora> jilles: try the release.
584556:<jilles> hmm, you still need a contrib module for topic bursting
584712:<jilles> remove capability to open attachments
584714:<jilles> disable internet explorer
584958:<jilles> on efnet, no, see www.irchelp.org/noserv
584960:<jilles> there is no channel registration either
584962:<jilles> but there is a service called chanfix which may help you if your channel gets opless or taken over
584964:<jilles> see http://www.efnet.org/chanfix/ (it has a better chance to work if you read its conditions before you are in trouble)
585006:<jilles> /mode #channel
585007:<jilles> you do not need to be in the channel
585008:<mews23> excellent - thank you jilles

587210:<jilles> I'm pretty sure you are trading copyrighted material without permission
587211:<jilles> ;p
587212:<jilles> txt files you can simply put on your web site
587476:<jilles> on connect and /version it should show: ... CHANTYPES=#& ...
587478:<jilles> meaning network-wide #channels and server-local &channels
588055:<JupaSaur> jilles are you here?
588085:<jilles> some ircds have channel modes that hide nonchanops from the /names list
588090:<Dianora> jilles what he is describing is a channel desync
588098:<jilles> Dianora, asuka has "auditorium mode" which shows only chanops in /names
588101:<jilles> it's meant to cut on join/part crap
588102:<jilles> I don't want it in ircd because it's often used by dronerunners
588108:<jilles> +n is checked on every server though
588110:<jilles> well if you include a timestamp, you will have to cancel a kick if it's inappropriate
588111:<jilles> otherwise the channel gets desynced
588112:<jilles> but you can only do that without additional machinery if the kick doesn't come from the victim's direction
588113:<JupaSaur> jilles and Dianora, any signficant reason(s) you pick *bsd over linux?
588118:<jilles> I never used linux that much
588120:<jilles> but when I have to use linux I don't like it much
588132:<jilles> *BSD is more consistent because kernel and userland are developed as a whole
588134:<Dianora> what jilles just said
588150:<jilles> userland is /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin and the like
588156:<jilles> yes
588159:<jilles> 5.0 is *old*

596798:<jilles> even if the network has channel services, it may be fairly hard to register a channel
596800:<jilles> that differs per network
596802:<jilles> main example is undernet
596804:<jilles> on undernet, you have to keep the channel open for a fairly long time with lots of people in it, before you can register
596807:<jilles> there are also networks where you can register a nick/username, create a channel and register it right away
596811:<jilles> perhaps try to find a network whose theme fits with your channel
597009:<JupaSaur> jilles are you here?
597047:<jilles> doesn't matter
597049:<jilles> in this case
597430:<JupaSaur> thanks for the help with that RuyDuck and jilles :-)

597944:<jilles> willfaith  It seems you are pretty new to irc. many if not all of your questions likely are answered at http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/ircprimer.html
597988:<jilles> what's the exact error message?
597991:<jilles> I did /mode #videopimp b and it showed a ban *!*me@*
597992:<jilles> pretty recent though
597994:<jilles> and doesn't really look like it's meant for you
597995:<jilles> you could change your user name so it doesn't end in "me"
597996:<jilles> but if you were in there before and were banned, it's ban evasion, very bad
597998:<jilles> change your "user name", "ident" or "email address" in one of the settings
598003:<jilles> you'll have to reconnect to the IRC server for the change to take effect
598005:<jilles> whois yourself to verify it worked
598488:<jilles> use a web based listing
598490:<jilles> www.irchelp.org has some, as does www.efnet.org/?module=channels
598919:<jilles> connect to a server on that network then join the channel :)
598922:<jilles> Wercco  It seems you are pretty new to irc. many if not all of your questions likely are answered at http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/ircprimer.html
598923:<jilles> you may try the network's web site
599436:<jilles> and make it appear in the channel window, you already get ServerMode +nt and the like in there
599438:<jilles> some clients don't display a motd at all; then again, some clients don't display any server notices either
599439:<JupaSaur> jilles the server could put a msg in a channel window even if it is +nt
599441:<jilles> of course
599444:<jilles> or it could be a numeric
599446:<jilles> if you say "server notice" I would mean a server notice to the channel
599451:<jilles> like the "*** Notice -- TS for #bleh changed from 2 to 1"
599453:<jilles> new channel creation is done by whatever server the creater is using
599455:<jilles> for example, if you create a channel on a csircd server, it's not set +nt
599457:<jilles> this would not apply to all servers
599467:<jilles> better send them to the new channel operator's guide then
599468:<jilles> ;p
599469:<JupaSaur> that's fine jilles
599551:<jilles> most blacklists are meant for mail servers, not IRC or blog comments or whatever
599553:<jilles> they don't take dynamic ips into account for expiry times
599556:<jilles> hmm, seems it's dialup
599558:<jilles> yeah
599559:<jilles> not worth the trouble to go for a removal for a dialup
599560:<jilles> unless it always happens
599561:<jilles> you can try dialing in again and see if you get a different ip
599564:<jilles> ahbl.org have a separate blacklist for IRC, though
599565:<jilles> no idea why that channel doesn't use that one instead
599626:<jilles> server hops
599628:<jilles> 0 means it's on the same server as you
599631:<GhettoMan> jilles : What is the  *   after Here ?
599632:<jilles> opered
599633:<jilles> i.e. IRC operator
599641:<jilles> yes
599668:<jilles> GhettoMan, who can't be seen
599669:<jilles> whois can often be seen but only if it's executed on the oper's server (you're on the same server as them or you do /wii)
599670:<GhettoMan> jilles : ok, thanks
599671:<jilles> another way to say this, if you see idle time, they may be notified
599673:<jilles> only if you're on the same server or you give two args there
599678:<jilles> that's no longer the case
599682:<jilles> all opers are globally visible as opers
599693:<LapJup> jilles:  when did they change that?
599696:<jilles> LapJup, hybrid 6 didn't have o:lines anymore already
599700:<jilles> they kept all the other privilege distinction between o: and O:
599701:<jilles> and added even more
599703:<jilles> there's a lot to say for having operator status visible everywhere
599705:<jilles> even if that operator status can only affect local users
599706:<jilles> umode +O, which wasn't propagated, is gone

600264:<JupaSaur> jilles are you here?
600268:<jilles> JupaSaur, yes?
601020:<jilles> when you create a channel, and get initial ops, the TS is set
601025:<jilles> usually shown in the form "Channel #bleh created Wed Aug  3 ..."
601026:<jilles> also when you join
601029:<jilles> if two parts of the net come together and have different TS, only the oldest TS ops are kept
601034:<SerialATA> that was for jilles..
601037:<jilles> chanfix uses this for fixing by creating a fake channel with a TS that is 1 second earlier, deopping everyone even on split servers
601038:<jilles> that's the only way you'll likely get "TS for #channel changed" on efnet
601039:<jilles> unless someone is abusing a hole in no create on split
601040:<jilles> or people in a channel aren't well enough spread across servers
601051:<SerialATA> would you like to add to what jilles said a little while back
601366:<jilles> how so?
601370:<jilles> your bot will get a JOIN message
601374:<jilles> you can check that for yourself :p
601376:<jilles> and besides hardcoding that too much will bite you later

609343:<jilles> the older servers don't throttle channels at all, I think
609437:<jilles> not for nick/join/part flooding though :)
609438:<Dianora> nick flooding control is there jilles
609442:<jilles> but that's per-client
609445:<jilles> doesn't stop 200 bots from generating 1000 lines of nick changes at once
609447:<jilles> well, the flood_endgrace() on nick changes does
609450:<jilles> by default, 10 (floodcount)
609451:<Dianora> jilles: I've been thinking about other anti flooding code. no worries.
609452:<Dianora> jilles: I already have coded up some code for trial...
609461:<jilles> the "spambot" checks seem to catch stuff still
609462:<jilles> (joining and parting too much)
609463:<Dianora> jilles thanks :-)
609465:<jilles> well I hardly get any spam on efnet
609467:<jilles> I think the spamtraps also help quite a bit
609475:<jilles> what's that?
609494:<jilles> openchanfix is implemented in a different way from most services
609499:<jilles> openchanfix is a patched ircd-ratbox 2.0.x, basically
609501:<jilles> while most other services contain an own implementation of the server-server protocol
609502:<jilles> also, chanfix has rather different concerns from chanserv
609505:<jilles> the global clone check looks fairly specific too
609506:<jilles> well, the action it does when triggered
609512:<jilles> that's just using the same protocol commands
609515:<jilles> chanfix doesn't allow opers to op whoever they want in a channel
609518:<jilles> kolp, you may try /who #channel
609519:<jilles> Jupiter, nope
609520:<jilles> channel must be cycled then

616814:<jilles> no need to send more than one part (their own) per client
616815:<Dianora> jilles: correct.
616818:<jilles> just keep it
616819:<jilles> and send ServerModes
616826:<jilles> only if all servers support it though
616833:<jilles> yup
616836:<jilles> rate limit it like /info
616839:<jilles> how about +G then? ;p
616846:<jilles> +G eats lots of cpu
616850:<jilles> silence on ban isn't that bad

616857:<jilles> restricting the check to local clients should save quite a bit of cpu, but it also limits functionality

618056:<jilles> be patient, or configure your firewall such that it accepts or rejects ident requests (tcp port 113)
618058:<jilles> or do the other servers let you in right away?
618061:<jilles> I know of some ircds with broken ident timeouts
618062:<jilles> you have to wait for minutes on those if you drop ident
618066:<jilles> perhaps they accept or reject 113
618228:<jilles> change the ident
618234:<jilles> then stay away for a week or even longer
618389:<jilles> zakariae, anything to ask? :)
618425:<jilles> it also shows the weather at your place to other people in the channel
618427:<TooCool> jilles : This bot sends by private notice.
618429:<jilles> ah ok then a website works just as well
619902:<jilles> you cannot register nicks or channels on EFnet
619903:<jilles> see www.irchelp.org/noserv
620328:<jilles> +g blocks private messages (ctcp or not)
620329:<jilles> channel ctcp is unaffected
620429:<jilles> hurkat_da http://www.efnet.info/chanfix/
621290:<jilles> it could work if it were limited to a certain number of replies per time unit, globally
621291:<jilles> too many, drop it
621293:<jilles> and a single notice would do
621294:<jilles> so it's no worse than a remote /version or similar
621298:<jilles> TooCool, not nice if someone does /msg nickserv from a (misconfigured) bot
621299:<jilles> and the bot replies to everyone
621551:<jilles> many blacklists aren't designed for IRC
621552:<jilles> but they're used anyway because they block a lot of abuse
621553:<jilles> the inevitable result is that some innocent users are hit
621555:<jilles> (the problem is, mainly, that the expiry time doesn't take dynamic IPs into account)
621558:<jilles> if your ip is more or less static, try to get removed
621559:<jilles> if your ip is dynamic, get a new ip
621561:<jilles> but if you still have a few servers to use, leave it at that

624818:<jilles> don't have directories where anonymous users can both read and write
624822:<jilles> depends on what you want
624824:<jilles> anonymous downloading is rather similar to a web site
625241:<jilles> note that chanfix is solely meant as a last resort
625242:<jilles> not as a service to be used daily
625243:<jilles> you're still responsible for running your own channel
625253:<jilles> if you get a new ip on each connection there's little point
625256:<^Matt^> yeah jilles has a good point;)
625258:<jilles> then you can't use chanfix with your current connection
625262:<jilles> with good channel management you'll rarely need chanfix anyway
625264:<jilles> and if you want your channel open all the time, you'll need other clients holding ops, too
625267:<jilles> lists in clients can be obsolete, use the irc network's web site instead, www.efnet.org/?module=servers
625271:<^Matt^> thank you jilles i was tryign to find out what that was again
625286:<jilles> there is /whowas and that's it
625287:<jilles> it doesn't go back any further than a few hours
625453:<jilles> just too late :(
625454:<jilles> it's to do with connection time, ircop status and chanop status
625460:<jilles> ok, I have the source in front of me
625462:<jilles> to have a part message, you must be a chanop, or you must be able to send to the channel and have been connected for the anti_spam_exit_message_time
625464:<jilles> to have a quit message, you must be an ircop or be connected for at least the anti_spam_exit_message_time
625465:<jilles> default anti_spam_exit_message_time is 5 minutes
625469:<jilles> some networks also drop quit messages if you can't send to all channels you're in
625471:<jilles> but ratbox doesn't
625472:<jilles> so if you really want to send a line of text to a +m channel without voice, you can
625473:<jilles> by quitting
625475:<jilles> it's not a problem
625478:<jilles> if the quit message is suppressed because you've not been connected long enough, it's changed to Client Quit
625481:<jilles> part messages are just changed to the empty string
625485:<jilles> which gives the drone detectors more time to do their job
625491:<jilles> it could be the reply added lots of new material
625528:<jilles> use ports
625553:<jilles> get a somewhat recent ports tree

645725:<jilles> it probably does NAT, which can be a good thing for security and for using the internet with multiple computers
645728:<jilles> for IRC, the simplest workaround is to periodically (e.g. once per minute) /quote ping :<yournick>
645729:<jilles> most IRC clients except mIRC do that by default

650548:<jilles> |2inch seems to be right that people on irc.daxnet.no can't receive invites
650550:<jilles> from people on other servers
650551:<jilles> from the source I can see that invites will not propagate if a hybrid 7.1.2 server is directly linked to a 7.0.x one
650552:<jilles> due to a silliness in 7.0.x

650605:<jilles> well full explanation
650606:<jilles> some time ago, hub.dk was upgraded to ratbox 2.0 which sends TSes on server-server invite
650607:<jilles> hybrid 7.0 gets confused by this
650608:<jilles> |2inch, you found someone already?
650615:<jilles> perhaps you can make bots set some invite exceptions (+I) for you
650626:<jilles> ask if they can link the server to a hybrid 6 hub
650628:<jilles> or if they want a patch for hybrid 7.0 they should msg me (or a hybrid developer if they still care)

661557:<jilles> also abusive people
661558:<jilles> and it can be hard to properly ban them from the shell
661562:<jilles> `plot`, no
661564:<jilles> the payment means that people can't just go on creating new accounts
661566:<jilles> and the people running the service can allow or deny users accounts
661570:<jilles> then run your channel without a bot
661571:<jilles> or let another chanop run one
661573:<jilles> you can still get klined
661574:<jilles> avoid using the same ip as idiots
661577:<jilles> hmm, then it's also easy to get killed for clones
661579:<jilles> that works to some extent but not unlimited
661581:<jilles> there are things that check for global u@h and *@h counts
661584:<jilles> there are networks that don't have such things, but efnet is not one of them
661677:<jilles> it's trivial to fake u@h of your bot

662566:<jilles> flooding, probably
662567:<jilles> there's no way to avoid it, unless the channel is -n
662568:<jilles> as if it's +n, the only way to find out it's juped is trying to join
662572:<jilles> if it's -mn you can try to send to it, if it's juped you'll fail, otherwise you'll succeed
662575:<jilles> and that is fully safe, except for what the channel thinks of it
662576:<jilles> well there is a dirty method
662578:<jilles> use a spare IP, be it an open proxy
662579:<jilles> and send a join command _right away_
662583:<jilles> often they're not klined but will be klined a few seconds after connect
662584:<jilles> that's enough time to figure out if a chan is juped
662585:<jilles> :P
662586:<jilles> THA SECRET
662588:<jilles> or if you can get a new ip, just get a new one if you're klined
662591:<jilles> also an option
662593:<jilles> note that people _might_ be in a channel that is juped on their server, if they joined before it was juped or if they're exempt somehow
662599:<jilles> hmm, IsleClass used efnet.demon.co.uk before
662600:<jilles> ISTR that that server does not kline for a single attempt to join a juped channel
662601:<jilles> on the second or third attempt or so
662608:<jilles> there could be other users on that IP
662609:<jilles> who also tried
662614:<jilles> unfortunately you can't be sure :(
662617:<jilles> jupes can be added dynamically
662619:<jilles> and if you then join, you may be nailed
662622:<jilles> no idea
662623:<jilles> also be *very* wary if you can't send to a channel you should be able to send to
662627:<jilles> if you're only interested in that one channel the klines don't really matter
662629:<IsleClass> thanks again for your help, jilles, JupaSaur, and kozmik

668372:<jilles> yeah the client could have issues as well
668443:<jilles> not all servers are so friendly as to warn you first
668445:<jilles> EmleyMoor, not on all servers
668446:<jilles> several servers kline on the first attempt
668448:<jilles> then you have to use a spare ip, say an open proxy, to find out
668449:<jilles> if you don't want your real ip klined

672774:<jilles> I think all efnet servers have it set to 100
672776:<jilles> this only means local clients can only add +beI if there are 99 or less currently
673386:<jilles> most efnet servers don't allow you to search by name in /list, only by # users
673396:<jilles> Neur0FX, not really, a web page can fulfill that function in a better way
673397:<Neur0FX> jilles, but shouldn't that function be performed from the irc client?
673493:<jilles> sadly, sometimes that's done
673495:<jilles> e.g. in the form of juping the channel which causes all regulars to be klined
673682:<jilles> that's no problem if you only want to run linux/freebsd on your xbox

674276:<jilles> that's not certain
674277:<jilles> often, shell companies "buy" IP addresses
674279:<jilles> "buying" IP addresses is always from criminals that have hijacked unused but assigned IP space
674282:<jilles> IP addresses are assigned to organizations and may only be used for the organization itself or its customers
674283:<jilles> selling is prohibited
674340:<jilles> well you can have dns polluted hosts on the web too, but then they don't consume IP space
674345:<jilles> there may be another reason why "shell companies" need "too many" IPs
674346:<jilles> users-per-ip and users-per-/24 limits
674348:<jilles> IRC admins set certain limits, and up to a certain degree if they allow less users per IP space the shell companies will just get more IPs
674349:<jilles> and that's also quite a waste of IP
674350:<jilles> the only real solution for that seems to be abandoning the notion of a "shell company" and require everyone to IRC from home/school/whatever
674351:<jilles> collaboration between IRC admins and shell companies being quite problematic
674352:<jilles> there are just too many
674398:<jilles> perhaps you joined a channel on the wrong server, so creating it on that server

676436:<jilles> not necessarily
676439:<jilles> if you dump enough lines or bytes at ircd it will throw you out for excess flood
676442:<lil0ne-> just got here, saw only the last line jilles.
676443:<jilles> if the client throttles itself it's less likely to flood off
676444:<jilles> with tricks like ping commands you can avoid it entirely but at a price
676445:<jilles> and your client depends on a particular ircd then
676448:<jilles> it simulates the throttling algorithm in ircd 2.8
676449:<jilles> you will still flood off if there is a large enough lag burst while you're pasting something
676451:<jilles> excess flood is about what's queued, not what you've executed recently
676452:<jilles> also, hyb6 penalizes you more for long lines
676453:<jilles> traditionally the penalty is 2 seconds for any line
676454:<jilles> in hyb6 it's 2 + L / 120 where L is the length in bytes (integer division)
676455:<jilles> hyb7/ratbox reverted to the traditional penalty
676456:<jilles> and, hyb6 decides excess flood based on bytes, hyb7/ratbox based on lines
676458:<jilles> csircd uses some very weird scheme
676460:<jilles> another thing that irssi doesn't know is hyb7/ratbox's flood grace period
676461:<jilles> at connection you may execute about 40 commands right away, as long as there's no privmsg, notice, mode change, kick, nick change, and a few more

677826:<jilles> it's usually 4 on efnet
677858:<jilles> only if the channel becomes entirely opless
677860:<jilles> but chanfix's action on takeovers is not automatic

677944:<jilles> LapJup, yes
677946:<jilles> but must have >=4 total clients
677949:<jilles> actually there's something obsolete in those conditions

681893:<jilles> make sure you have oper/admin access to services
681894:<jilles> likely, ircop is not enough
681897:<jilles> for hybserv and derivatives you have to identify to nickserv and then to operserv
681899:<jilles> I suspect you're not using hybserv though
681909:<jilles> what services package is it
681912:<jilles> no idea what that is
681913:<jilles> it could be you're not on a list of services admins/roots

682393:<jilles>           SendQ exceeded]
682396:<jilles> newer ratboxes limit global who to 500 matches
682397:<jilles> they also rate limit it severely, I find it quite rare that I can actually execute one
682876:<jilles> you can estimate from logs of course
682877:<jilles> to get a high score have a 24*7 connection and ensure you're opped when you join
683252:<jilles> yes that's how it works
683253:<jilles> leave off the # on the channel name (yeah this means you can only link to channels starting with '#' -- silly)
683526:<jilles> wmono, try vmstat or iostat
683527:<wmono> cool, thanks jilles
683528:<jilles> that's an average over the whole uptime of the system though
683539:<jilles> you can do 'vmstat 5' to get something every 5 seconds
683542:<jilles> (afaik that'll average over those 5 seconds only)
683563:<jilles> vmstat -i  is interrupt counts
683594:<jilles> solaris doesn't have top
683596:<jilles> use prstat
683602:<jilles> Dianora, yeah it exists but not in base
683604:<Dianora> jilles knows solwars
683767:<jilles> does ircd-hybrid have any facility for keeping services login info across netsplits or services restarts?
683769:<jilles> a key property of chanfix is its "black magic"
683773:<jilles> for efnet, that's a desired thing, it prevents users from relying on it too much
683775:<jilles> well s/prevents/discourages/
683776:<jilles> however, for your server it's no problem if your users rely upon services
683781:<jilles> then set the channel expiry time fairly short
683783:<jilles> and make it clear to users that gone is gone
683788:<jilles> or they just join their once a week
683789:<Dianora> oh yeah jilles is one of the developers of athem (hi jilles)
683790:<jilles> their channel
683792:<jilles> hi
683796:<jilles> there's also ratbox-services, although you may find some "feature holes" when using it with a non-ratbox ircd
683800:<jilles> they all have nick and channel registration (with atheme and ratbox-services, nick registration is optional)
683802:<jilles> in atheme, nick registration can be enabled or disabled globally
683804:<jilles> in ratbox-services, users register a username and attach nicks and/or channels to that
683806:<jilles> again nick registration can be disabled globally
683809:<jilles> hmm, that makes me think of the way freenode does things
683812:<jilles> they disabled regular expiry in services; instead if you want an expired nick (time published on website) you have to ask a staffer to drop it
683815:<jilles> however that may leave channels lying around rather long
683816:<jilles> I think it's a good approach for nicks but not for channels
683818:<jilles> that changes SecureOps behaviour somewhat
683819:<jilles> also think of channels locked +i or +k
683849:<jilles> from rfc1459:
683850:<jilles>       Command: JOIN
683851:<jilles>    Parameters: <channel>{,<channel>} [<key>{,<key>}]
683858:<jilles> yeah I can't easily find /join 0 in rfc1459
683869:<jilles> I've never seen a (real) ircd that doesn't implement join 0
683882:<jilles> no that's not really why it's so
683883:<jilles> it is because long ago channels were named by integers
683885:<jilles> and you could only join one at a time
683888:<RuyDuck> jilles is the samrt one
683889:<jilles> initially you were put in channel 0
683890:<jilles> you can also still see this in the who command: /who 0 tries to list everyone you can see
683892:<jilles> (and may thus flood you off)
683899:<jilles> rfc2812 does mention join 0

699354:<jilles> that error message can mean two things

699721:<jilles> CTCP is not in it at all
699722:<jilles> there are separate specs for it which are not very official
699724:<jilles> I consider it is a part of "IRC protocol" though
699727:<jilles> because it's a function that needs to be standardized somehow if it is to work between different clients
699728:<jilles> some ircds (dalnet's in particular) even try to detect and block DCC
699730:<jilles> it should be a separate document, but referenced by the "IRC" client-server spec
699732:<jilles> dalnet did that to curb virus/trojan spreading

699737:<jilles> ratbox/hybrid don't try to detect dcc

706965:<jilles> many ircds come with ChanServ etc nicks pre-resv'ed in the example confs
707250:<jilles> times out from here (unless you restricted it to the IRC servers)
707258:<argz> jilles: it does? damn :/
707267:<jilles> make sure your ISP doesn't run a NAT
707270:<jilles> make sure you can see your IP (65.93.140.85) configured in *some* device you control
707273:<jilles> dynamic IP is no problem
707274:<jilles> it just needs to be on your router
707276:<jilles> (or your pc, if you don't have a router)
707279:<jilles> if you can't accept any connections you can't enable identd, yes :(
707281:<jilles> it can also be informative to check the ip address on your pc
707282:<jilles> if something like 192.168.* or 10.* there's some kind of NAT somewhere

717079:<jilles> can't be sure
717080:<jilles> my gut feeling is that something (within ircd or in their dns server) has broken down somehow

717086:<jilles> akai
717131:<jilles> yeah, and energy from fossil fuel is used to prepare that hydrogen and oxygen
717137:<LapJup> jilles, isn't it electrical energy that is used to make the liquied hydrogen and liquid oxygen?
717138:<jilles> but where does the electricity come from? ;p
717139:<jilles> sure, there are some solar and water electricity generators
717140:<jilles> and uranium

718229:<jilles> yes
718230:<jilles> just ask your question :)
718244:<jilles> irc.efnet.net is a roundrobin (picks a random server)
718245:<jilles> and not all servers can be pinged
718253:<jilles> you don't need to ping IRC servers to IRC
718255:<jilles> so then you're connected, what's the problem?
718258:<jilles> not all servers accept connections from all over the world
718261:<jilles> www.efnet.org/?module=servers
718262:<jilles> there's often some text describing from where clients are accepted
718389:<jilles> perhaps
718392:<jilles> channel or server bans?
718406:<jilles> that's common
718504:<jilles> you may not need bots
718506:<jilles> read this: www.irchelp.org/changuide
718698:<jilles> Anacardo, if someone says a certain keyword, norton goes OH HELL TROJAN and disconnects your IRC connection
718760:<jilles> hmm?
719063:<jilles> /mode <channel> -b <mask>
719064:<jilles> use /mode <channel> b to see all active bans
719066:<jilles> something nick!user@host with wildcards
719069:<jilles> depends on how the ban was made
719070:<jilles> see http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/irctutorial.html#chanmode
719076:<jilles> yeah that c8597c35 is a hexadecimal encoding of the ip address
719079:<jilles> if you have perl installed you can use http://babylon.otherwize.co.uk/releases/cgiirc-0.5.3/docs/decode.pl (first hit from google on decode cgiirc hexadecimal ip)
719080:<jilles> you can also /ctcp <nick> userinfo but I don't know whether the target will see if you are doing that
719081:<jilles> or maybe that was clientinfo
719082:<jilles> this one is 200.89.124.53 btw
719087:<jilles> LaZaRo, I used that decode.pl thing
719098:<jilles> ban evasion with cgiirc is lame
719102:<jilles> also note that by using cgiirc you are actually exposing more rather than less information about yourself
719106:<jilles> one of those ctcps shows your browser version and which OS you use
719108:<jilles> operating system
719109:<jilles> windows xp, windows 98, linux, freebsd, etc
719112:<jilles> no
719113:<jilles> but it exposes a little more information than a normal irc client
719114:<jilles> even though it may seem like it's the other way round
719173:<jilles> search wikipedia for "Internet troll"
719736:<jilles> you get what you pay for
719740:<jilles> "free hosting" can't be very good
719742:<jilles> because companies are there to earn $$$
719743:<jilles> not to help you

730447:<Olin> TooCool: I don't know if jilles has access in here to +o, but can I suggest he gains it? He knows his shit (and that's if he wants it, of course)
730452:<TooCool> jilles has helped me setup a few IRCDs
730462:<Olin> jilles knows RatBox inside out.
731128:<jilles> TooCool, okay
731131:<jilles> 22:53  TooCool GET: 0B of 445kB (0%) - 0.00kB/s - ETA (stalled) - efnet.ashlee.jpg
731133:<TooCool> thanks jilles
731134:<jilles> 22:54 [EFNet] DCC can't connect to 12.203.144.19 port 3334
731144:<jilles> go ahead
731145:<jilles> seems same
731826:<jilles> it should be on www.irchelp.org somewhere
732481:<jilles> you may like http://www.alien.net.au/irc/irc2numerics.html or http://mirror.irc101.org/documentation/numerics.php
732485:<jilles> where are you actually getting problems btw
732486:<jilles> also see http://www.irc.org/tech_docs/005.html
732487:<jilles> 005's PREFIX and CHANMODES are pretty important as several letters have totally different meanings on different ircds nowadays
732490:<jilles> I'd think trivia bots don't care about modes though
732502:<jilles> they have to be quite similar to link together
732506:<jilles> there are also quite some features which don't affect server-server traffic
732509:<jilles> like many user modes, commands like CPRIVMSG
732510:<jilles> rfc281x isn't that useful; it's about ircnet a few years ago only
732512:<jilles> stuff like !channels is IMHO totally not worth implementing
732515:<jilles> that's 100% client side
732516:<jilles> it's not to do with CTCP either
732518:<jilles> except /me which is ctcp action
732519:<jilles> seems rare
732522:<JupaSaur> sculptor as i think jilles already might have mentioned. you do not need to implement the entire rfc set to have a triva bot. there are many things it does not need to use. you really are developing a very specialized client whose main job is to present questions, ack correct answers, and keep scores

732737:<jilles> ping the server every once in a while
732739:<jilles> you can do it with a script, or mirc 6.17 has a setting for it
732745:<jilles> it's a setting; however I don't use mirc so I don't know where it is
732819:<jilles> nope
