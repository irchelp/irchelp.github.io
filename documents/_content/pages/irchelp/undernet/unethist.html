    Prologue
    ========
    
      This file is an attempt on my behalf to record for all posterity, the
    times that the undernet has gone through. There have been the bad times
    and then there have been the good times. But the amazing tenacity of a
    few persons has kept this dream alive and rekindled the spirit of the
    Undernet. This article attempts to explore the history of the undernet
    right from the hazy beginnings through turbid times to what the Undernet
    has evolved to, today. 
    
    	Since I have basically relied on _dl's archived mailing lists to 
    assemble this information, I must remain deeply indebted to him for the 
    wonderful work he's done in managing the wastelanders mailing list. The 
    file still lacks details of events that occurred before February, and the 
    first section will be updated after further research. If you have anything
    which may help me out in this quest, please feel free to mail me. Because
    this is a historical document, the author may be held guilty of bias, but
    wherever possible, an attempt at an impartial representation of the facts
    has been made.
    
    
    A history of IRC
    ================
    
    	Any kind of a historical document about the Undernet would be incomplete 
    without a mention of the history of IRC itself. To quote from Elizabeth Reid's
    Electropolis paper, which is essentially a thesis report on Communication and
    Community, in particular the Internet Relay Chat :
    
    "Jarkko Oikarinen wrote the original IRC program at the University of
    Oulu, Finland, in 1988. He designed IRC as a 'client-server' program.
    The user runs a 'client' program from his or her local machine, which
    then connects, via the Internet, to a 'server' program which may not
    be running on that local machine. There are hundreds of IRC 'servers'
    over the world, all of which communicate with each other and pass
    information back to the client programs - and users - connected to
    them. IRC was first tested on a single machine with less than twenty
    users participating. IRC's networking capabilities were then tested
    on a suite of three machines in southern Finland. Once tested it was
    installed throughout the Finnish national network - FUNET - and then
    connected to NORDUNET, the Scandinavian branch of the Internet. By
    November of 1988, IRC had spread across the Internet. The latest
    listing of countries whose Internet branches host IRC include
    Australia, the United States, Italy, Israel and Korea."
    
    	The original Finnish net was often termed the "O-net". The first 
    international link established was between Finland and Sweden. Switzerland, 
    US, Canada, Norway, Poland (for a while), Netherlands, Australia, followed suit 
    shortly afterwards. In the middle of 1989, there were about 40 servers and 10 
    users on most nights. IRC had yet to come of age. But in these quiet times as
    well, trouble arose in 1990.
    
    	In the beginning of 1990, a net for server development called the 
    ChNet was formed. It consisted of about 25 servers and no users. It was used
    to develop the 2.7 version which can be found even now (1993) on the EFnet.
    However, this was soon dissolved after a period of 3-4 months, due to
    disagreements between the programmers. By this time, Avalon (Darren Reed) had
    been approved of by Jarkko amongst others to be the official releaser of ircd
    versions. However, certain GNU programmers at MIT wanted to release code for
    ircd as well (Mycroft@IRC in particular) which did not fit in very well with
    Avalon's plans, and so the ChNet was dissolved. Soon after, a more radical
    split was to occur on the actual IRC network itself.
    
    	To quote from Helen Trillian Rose's Networking documentation found
    alongwith the IRC server (updated in Oct. 1990):
    
    "In August of 1990, IRC suffered a critical split in viewpoints of key
    people in the IRC heirarchy. The result was IRC split into two networks,
    EFnet (Eris Free network) and Anet (Anarchy network). This split continues
    today. There is some debate over whether IRC will ever reunite, however,
    neither side is willing to bend from their standpoint. Currently, there are
    about 95 servers on EFnet (and the same number of users) and 15 servers on 
    Anet (and about half the number of users)."
    
    	The A-net proposed a central server called eris.berkeley.edu in the
    US that everyone connect to (with similar plans for such servers in Europe and 
    the rest of the world), which had was "open connect" i.e., no passwords were
    required to connect to it, and there was no limit on the no. of servers. As a
    result of opposing ideologies (the EFnet believed in a backbone plan based on
    net routes, ping times, etc.), the eris server was the first server to be Q
    (quarantine) lined from IRC (Q lining a server causes any server which
    introduces a Q lined server, to be dropped as well). The other servers along
    with eris formed the A-net. As of today (Aug. 1993), the A-net is almost non
    existent, with the EFnet having expanded rapidly.
    
       	IRC  gained  international fame during the late Persian Gulf War, when
    updates  from  around  the world came across the wire, and most people on
    IRC gathered on a single channel to hear these reports.
    
    	Another one of the splinter nets formed once IRC became popular was
    the TubNet. This was when EF-Net started falling apart. There were a number of
    attempts to form other networks. But because they were run by people who really 
    only wanted to talk.. and not by people who wanted the systems to work well,
    they all fell off. TubNet was formed in June 1991. It was created for all the
    #hottub'ers who did not like the netsplits. TubNet at its height had 5
    servers, and around 100 people. The servers were located in Caltech,
    Washington DC, Montreal, South Africa and UK. It lasted from June to
    September. The net dissolved because the admins at the other sites got angry
    at unofficial servers.
    
    	Finally in the January of 1993, the Undernet was born, when the local
    US net (started by Wildthang - Daniel Mitchell) merged with the servers in
    France and Canada run by _dl (Laurent Demailly) and Whizzard (Donnie Lambert)
    respectively. The Undernet has shown tremendous tenacity as compared to the 
    other nets, and as this document goes on to display, it is the sheer enthusiasm
    on the behalf of opers that have helped to keep the net alive during hard times.
    Today (Aug. 1993) the Undernet has over 30 servers, all over the world, with
    at least around 500-1000 users having visited it, 200 of them more than once!
    The Undernet continues to grow and confound its disparagers, and this is a story
    of a net that was born out of the wilderness, and which didn't give in no 
    matter what the others felt, to finally start becoming more popular.
    
    
    
    A new star is born - Christmas '92
    ==================================
    
    	As far ago as the October of 1992, people had already started
    feeling the effects of user overload on EFnet, not to mention many other
    factors. In an effort to strike out new territory in cyberspace, many
    "groups" of individuals had relentlessly attempted to sustain the onslaught of
    the forbidding isolation, and start up a server of their own. Many failed
    in their ventures, many just got bored of it and many just got shut down
    forcibly by paranoid system admins. Through the scattered outposts of the
    mysterious vaccum emerged 2 groups of entrepreneurs. The undernet in itself
    has two different tales to tell. Yes...the tale of two nets. One in the US,
    one in Europe-Canada. 
    
    	The US undernet started off way back in Oct 92, when Wildthang
    put up essex.ecn.uoknor.edu (and linked it to underworld [skywarrior])
    to start up a local test net. It started off as a playground to test
    bots at first, but quickly, the idea of a net hidden from the main net
    and a "friends and their friends" network grew more appealing. In mid
    November, Munchie (Andrew Daniels) joined Wildthang and set up the first
    US link essex->blackfoot.ucs.indiana.edu. Soone after Xney joined them with
    his server ux4.cso.uiuc.edu. By Christmas time, Wildthang linked the US
    net to the servers run by WHIZZARD and _dl. 
    
    	A mention must also be made of the "visitor servers" which linked 
    to the Undernet to soon proceed to the EFnet.  One of these was the server 
    run by Lightning (Edward Poffenbarger) who had troubles compiling it initially 
    on a NeXt, but with the help of his sys. admin eventually managed to compile 
    it, and later migrated to the EFnet. Another server which was temporarily 
    linked to the undernet was one run by SpUr (Mushfiqur Rahman) from Uni. of 
    Texas, (on port 6669) but was soon brought down due to pessimism expressed on 
    behalf of the co-admin (Rodder) and the lack of time to maintain it.  lonestar.
    utsa.edu (Longy) and inga1.acc.stolaf.edu (Dannyboy) joined in soon afterwards. 
    There were then also pace2.mts.edu which ran only parttime, and one at
    chip.ucdavis.edu which was run without admin approval, and almost resulted in
    the revokal of the IRC admin's account. Another old timer was TempT who linked
    in CRUX1.cit.cornell.edu.
    
    	On the European side, _dl had already set up his server - hplyot.obspm.
    circe.fr, and in early December linked *.fr to *.ca. The Canadian venture was 
    headed by WHIZZARD in the guise of taurus.ccs.tuns.ca. Taurus was originally
    set up in November 92, and linked to *.ariel.yorku.ca on the EFnet. Kangaman
    and Wildmage were WHIZZARD's uplinks on EFnet. However the uplink of
    *.ariel.yorku.ca - Nevster, got Whizzard's link on the EFnet revoked. Finally,
    Whizzard had a talk with _dl, and set up the Canada-France link. The
    *.ariel.yorku.ca server soon followed suit and linked to the Undernet as well.
    On the French side, _dl had originally set up a net to test the 2.8 series of
    servers along with dp (P. Ducrot) as well. Later on, after the dissolution of
    the test net, he linked to WHIZZARD's server in December. dp joined him on the 
    Undernet soon afterwards, with his server ismra.ismra.fr.
    
     	In the last week of December '92, the 2 nets merged and formed what 
    came to be called later on as the "Undernet". A mailing list was founded by _dl 
    on Feb 5th, 1993, to start the ball rolling! A channel called #wasteland was 
    proposed by WHIZZARD and accepted by others, as the channel for opers, and a 
    bot called Wastedump was set up to "guard" the bleak landscape. 
    
    	Ever since, a wide variety of servers have appeared and dissappeared
    from the face of the Undernet, but the ones that have clung on have always 
    carried forth the spirit. In the face of all odds, against an almost 
    non-existent userbase, they have clung on to one another, each oper giving 
    encouragement to the other, trying to lighten up those gloomy days spent when 
    there were hardly any users, and not a single soul ventured to enter the 
    underworld. The reasons for servers dropping off have been many - accounts 
    no longer active, sys admin dissapproval, disheartment at the lack of 
    userbase, and so on. Nevertheless, the Undernet lived on.....
    
    	As a piece of antiquity, here's the first ever e-mail message to the
    wastelanders mailing list.

      connected.
    
    * 5th March, Wildmage withdraws from the Undernet, and takes off iris.ariel
      yorku.ca, citing a reason of "lack of userbase".
    
    * 14th Mar, camelot.bradley gets Q-lined (first server to be Q lined) for fear
      that it is a hacked server. The Q lines are removed later.....lots of confusion
      abounds.
    
    * 15 Mar, crux.cit.cornell goes down. IQ wants to form his own net on port
      9876.
    
    * 17th Mar, due to absence of backup links, the undernet at one time holds
      only  5 servers!
    
    * 22nd Mar, IQ takes shade, spot and columbia off into his own net.
    
    * 23rd Mar, TBA (alex Skrabut) proposes new east coast server at Hofstra
      University, Long Island, NY, USA.

      delinked almost immediately by sheeba.
    
    * 28th Mar, Dannyboy and  Mmmm post first messages to wastelanders.
    
    * 29th Mar, Tony asks for new ping times from everyone.  Wastelanders is
      promptly flooded with ping stats. from everyone.
    
    * 30th Mar, Dregyon asks to be added to the wastelanders. Burnt from previous
      experiences, the wastelanders promise to take care when handing out new
      links.
    
    * anatsg is proposed as the new European hub, based on pings.
    
    
    
    April 1993 - L lines and bots!
    ===============================
    
    * 3rd Apr, the first undernet oper meeting takes place. TBA discusses his
      "web" routing.
    
    * 6th Apr, Riot posts first wastelanders message.
    
    * 6th Apr, utexas enters the undernet again - flubber.cc.utexas.edu, run by

    * 10th Apr., IQ declares utexas as a hub server without previous notification
      or discussion with operators. Dat declares cornell to be a hub in the same
      arrogant fashion, and refuses to reason with opers. They even go ahead and
      start changing the routing radically without asking the rest about what they
      feel. Tired of it, the wastelanders finally employ L lines to employ a good
      hub / leaf routing. _dl the opposer of any L line /die's his server for a
      day, in protest.
    
    * 10th Apr, nikita proposes hostmasking regions, with a detailed plan.
    
    * 12th Apr, _dl is out of town, and the wastelanders mailing list has slight
      problems. hop makes a backup mailing list, but _dl gets pissed.

      spiff, and so doea sugar-bombs.
    
    * 17th Apr, Chucki proposes a new server at santafe.edu run by bogus.
    
    * 19th Apr, first message to wastelanders by mailer (admin of viminale*fr).
    
    * 19th Apr, camelot.bradley is pulled down by the disapproving sys admin. Mmmm
      sends letter to try and save the server to no avail.
    
    * 20th Apr, first post from tc (Tewwy) to the wastelanders. He posts the
      European map, the American map and a routing plan in great detail.
    
    * 21st Apr, curie.ualr.edu gets linked with Kham and TG as opers.
    
    * 22nd Apr, the great bot debate is sparked off. Finally it is decided that no
      remote bots will be allowed, and each server admin will fram his own bot
      policy. Tony posts the bot policy for pv1628*.
    
    * 22nd Apr, _dl puts up new mailing list server - listserv, which makes mail
      handling highly efficient.

      unexpected core dumps and their inability to work with old clients.
    
    * 29th Apr, the wastelanders user average drops to 10 as exams approach.
    
    
    MAY 1993 - timestamps and mass posts
    =====================================
    
    * 2nd May, the bot debate rages....
    
    * TempT posts first message to the wastelanders (although crux1 is no longer
      around).
    
    * Chucki makes a huge mistake of deleting his ircd directory on spiff :). So
      he requests everyone to add links for Sugar-Bombs.
    
    * 3rd May, many admins post local bot policies.
    
    * 3rd May, TG posts first message to wastelanders.
    
    * 4th May, new link from Netherlands - sg.tn.tudelft.nl (admin Run) is set up
      by _dl.
    
    * 6th May, elm.circa.ufl.edu goes down temporarily.
    
    * 8th May, WHIZZARD proposes limiting no. of bans.
    
    * 12th May,Chucki (by now a very confused soul :) asks everyone to delete lines
