You can often find [channels](../chanlist/) devoted to every conceivable
subject on the [popular nets](popular.html), but with that comes the hassles
of those large nets too. Some groups have set up specialized chat servers or
networks dedicated to a special subject of interest. Here are some of them,
loosely grouped by subject. Note that some subjects may not be appropriate for
all people. Many are web-based chats (not strictly IRC) or standalone servers.
