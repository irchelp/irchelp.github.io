Usage: BIND <key> SELF_INSERT
  Causes the key it is bound to to insert itself into the input
  buffer.  This is the default binding for the alphabet keys,
  numbers, etc.  If this is bound to a meta sequence, it will
  only insert the last key hit in the meta sequence.

Note:
  This is how you "unbind" a key.
