Usage: LOAD IRCPRIMER
  This script provided Nicolas.Pioch@grasp.insa-lyon.fr (Nap) as an
  example for the "IRCprimer" IRC guide available in PostScript,
  plain text or .tex (LaTeX source code).

  This is a simple script from the IRCprimer, which tries to implement
  various things such as shortening all useful commands to a single
  letter, speeding up scroll speed two times and displaying useful
  information whenever needed.
