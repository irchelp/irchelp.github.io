Usage: MOTD [<server>|<nickname>]
  Gives the message-of-the-day for the named server.  If no
  server is given, your server is used. If a nickname is 
  given it queries the server that that person is currently
  using.  You should be sure to check the MOTD regularly.
  Ignorance of the law is not a defense in any court in the
  land.
