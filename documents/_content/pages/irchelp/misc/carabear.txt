[23:57] <NoizyToyz> no twisting tht!
[23:57] <NoizyToyz> that
[23:57] <dracus> at least she didn't lay ON the keyboard.
[23:57] <NoizyToyz> she usually does that
[23:58] <CaraBear> Excuse me?
[23:58] <NoizyToyz> yep
[23:58] <Etude> you are excused
[23:58] <Etude> what did you do?  burp?
[23:58] <NoizyToyz> and she just knocked off the mouse
[23:58] <dracus> my cat used to type with her paws.
[23:58] <CaraBear> if I had a question about my computer that 
  I purchased would this be the place to ask?
[23:58] <NoizyToyz> dracus: mine does
[23:58] <Etude> probably not.  What was the question?
[23:58] <Apatrix> Unless your question relates to IRC, #help 
  might be a more appropriate place
[23:58] <Apatrix> But then we're bored :)
[23:58] <Apatrix> (as is evident from the current 
  conversation)
[23:59] <NoizyToyz> heh
[23:59] <CaraBear> oh, well anyone know of a good tech 
  channel?
[23:59] <NoizyToyz> here
[23:59] <CaraBear> or maybe I could get help here?
[23:59] <prysm-> what is the problem?
[23:59] <prysm-> you can ask
[23:59] <NoizyToyz> yeah
[23:59] <Apatrix> We're as suitable as any
[23:59] <prysm-> if we can't help, we can't help
[23:59] <NoizyToyz> were almost fully equipped tho :)
[00:00] <CaraBear> okay, well I just purchased this new Acer 
  that I just got set up tonight and everything seems to be 
  working just fine except for my mouse speed seems to be a 
  little lagged
[00:00] <CaraBear> but that's not the problem
[00:00] * Apatrix is well-equipped
[00:00] <CaraBear> it seems that it came with an external 
  modem, which i'm not very familiar with and I cannot for 
  the life of me figure out how to correctly hook it up
[00:00] <NoizyToyz> Apatrix: being well endowed is not 
  helping in this situation
[00:00] <Apatrix> Ah, external modems
[00:00] <NoizyToyz> Care: just plug it in
[00:00] <Apatrix> joy joy joy
[00:00] <CaraBear> I mean...I know where it hooks into the 
  power strip, but there aren't any slots to the computer
[00:00] <NoizyToyz> most modern computer autodetect
[00:01] <NoizyToyz> its prolly a USB
[00:01] <dracus> you'll need a cable to connect it to the 
  computer.
[00:01] <Apatrix> Last time I set up one of those was, umm, 
  four years ago
[00:01] <CaraBear> hmm
[00:01] <Apatrix> Must have come with some sort of cable
[00:01] <CaraBear> it is a brand new computer, this is my 
  first night using it and everything seems to be fine
[00:01] <NoizyToyz> i set up an external USB modem just a few 
  weeks ago
[00:01] <Etude> I would think so
[00:02] <Apatrix> How are you presently online, if not with 
  said modem?
[00:02] <CaraBear> the Internet
[00:02] <NoizyToyz> heh
[00:02] <NoizyToyz> wha?
[00:02] <NoizyToyz> how
[00:02] <NoizyToyz> how are you connected to the internet
[00:02] * Apatrix uses the Blank Look
[00:03] * NoizyToyz patents the Blank Look
[00:03] <CaraBear> umm, i'm using my new computer...
[00:03] <Apatrix> sorry pal, prior art
[00:03] <CaraBear> I clicked on the ISP thing?
[00:03] <NoizyToyz> with what?
[00:03] <Etude> are you currently on your new computer?  the 
  one with the external modem that you can't hook up?
[00:03] <NoizyToyz> a modem?
[00:03] <NoizyToyz> cable?
[00:03] <NoizyToyz> dsl?
[00:03] <Tailspin> If the modem isn't connected, you couldn't 
  dial into the internet  ?
[00:03] <NoizyToyz> phone line?
[00:03] * dracus smells something ...
[00:03] <CaraBear> I have an external modem
[00:03] <NoizyToyz> dracus: thats me
[00:03] <shuer> time for taller boots
[00:03] <CaraBear> but I cannot figure out how to hook it up
[00:03] <CaraBear> but I wanted to use ICQ and such
[00:03] <NoizyToyz> dracus: i havent bathed since yesterday
[00:04] * Apatrix smells after dracus
[00:04] <Tailspin> CaraBear , if your using it, Its hooked up
[00:04] <NoizyToyz> yeah
[00:04] <Etude> Give me a T
[00:04] <NoizyToyz> where did i put my hard hat?
[00:04] <NoizyToyz> T
[00:04] <Apatrix> Gimme an R
[00:04] <Etude> give me an r
[00:04] <NoizyToyz> R
[00:04] <CaraBear> well I figured out how to plug the modem 
  into the power strip but there wasn't anyplace on the 
  computer to hook it up to so I put that back in the box
[00:04] <NoizyToyz> R
[00:04] *** DriFan3 (~Skank@nic-31-c15-073.mn.mediaone.net)

  for, sence you obiously already have one in the computer, 
  that your now using to connect to the internet with
[00:05] <NoizyToyz> O!
[00:05] <shuer> ToyzRus
[00:05] <NoizyToyz> shuer: amen to that
[00:05] <CaraBear> Tailspin: I need to go online so that I 
  can use ICQ but I can't without finding out where to hook 
  up my external modem
[00:06] <Tailspin> CaraBear , you are online
[00:06] <NoizyToyz> care: YOU ARE ONLINE
[00:06] <CaraBear> how do you figure that one?

  magic ?
[00:06] <NoizyToyz> your here
[00:06] <Etude> Magic!
[00:06] <NoizyToyz> your onlie
[00:06] <Apatrix> These guys have amazing powers of deduction
[00:06] <NoizyToyz> man
[00:06] <CaraBear> ????
[00:06] <NoizyToyz> care: YOUR ONLINE
[00:07] <Etude> are you a good witch or a bad witch?
[00:07] <NoizyToyz> bad
[00:07] <dracus> L!
[00:07] <CaraBear> no...I don't need to get on the internet, 
  I need to go online to use ICQ and check my e-mail
[00:07] <Tailspin> CaraBear This is IRC, an internet chat 
  protocol, hence, to use it, you must be connected to the 
  internet
[00:07] <NoizyToyz> CaraBear: you wouldent be online if you 
  didnt have it hooked up right
[00:07] <NoizyToyz> E!
[00:07] <DriFan3> How can cara be online if she doesnt have 
  her modem hooked up?
[00:07] <Apatrix> Magic
[00:07] <NoizyToyz> DriFan3: thats what were deducing
[00:07] <Tailspin> CaraBear u have an AOL account or 
  something ?
[00:07] <CaraBear> no...i'm not online...and that's the 
  problem, I need to go there but I can't without my modem
[00:08] <Apatrix> I think there's a new telepathic interface 
  to IRC
[00:08] <NoizyToyz> its not resolved
[00:08] <CaraBear> *ugh* i'm not getting anywheres
[00:08] <NoizyToyz> YOU ARE ONLINE
[00:08] <Apatrix> No you're not
[00:08] <NoizyToyz> your talking to us
[00:08] <NoizyToyz> you ARE online
[00:08] <Tailspin> CaraBear , and even if you were, you 
  wouldn;t realise it

[00:08] <CaraBear> do you guys even know about this kinda 
  stuff or not?
[00:08] <Tayra> waitwaitwait
[00:08] <Tayra> i gotta see this
[00:08] <NoizyToyz> THATS WHAT THE INTERNET IS
[00:08] <Etude> Oh, That ONLINE!
[00:08] <Tayra> 'online' is when your modem is dialed into 
  your isp
[00:09] <Tayra> connected n stuff
[00:09] <Tayra> 'internet' is programs you use when you're 
  online.  sort of
[00:09] <CaraBear> exactly, and my modem isn't hooked up so 
  i'm not ONLINE

[00:10] <Tailspin> CaraBear How are you connected to the 
  internet , You need a modem to do that !
[00:10] *** Apatrix sets mode: +m
[00:10] <Apatrix> Thanks folks
[00:11] *** ironfist has quit IRC
[00:11] <Apatrix> Cara: the good people here are wondering 
  which of two conclusions to draw:
[00:11] *** Apatrix sets mode: +o Tailspin
[00:12] <Apatrix> whether you're having us on big-time or 
  truly lack some very basic knowledge
[00:12] *** Apatrix sets mode: -m
[00:12] <NoizyToyz> thanks apa
[00:12] <CaraBear> BLAH
[00:12] <CaraBear> oh
[00:12] <shuer> thanx  :)
[00:12] <CaraBear> there we go, somethings wrong with this 
  channel
[00:12] <CaraBear> I couldn't type anything?
[00:12] <NoizyToyz> heh
[00:12] <NoizyToyz> heh
[00:13] <Tailspin> CaraBear How are you connected to the 
  internet , You need a modem to do that ?
[00:13] <Apatrix> I shut everyone up with my amazing powers :)
[00:13] <NoizyToyz> CaraBear: yeah, it was broken
[00:13] <CaraBear> hrrmm...I took a GIS class last year if 
  that counts for basic knowledge?
[00:13] <NoizyToyz> Apatrix: you can finish with this one
[00:13] <CaraBear> it's this computer that I bought that is 
  troubling me
[00:13] <Apatrix> I think Tailspin is more qualified
[00:14] <CaraBear> hmm
[00:14] <Tailspin> then what ?
[00:14] <CaraBear> so does anyone know how I can seriously 
  get this modem hooked up
[00:14] <NoizyToyz> looks like it already is
[00:14] <CaraBear> I don't want you guys to fool around 
  anymore pls?
[00:14] <Apatrix> We're not fooling around
[00:14] <DriFan3> Can I upgrade the processor in my keyboard 
  to allow me to type faster?
[00:14] <Apatrix> We're genuinely confused
[00:14] <NoizyToyz> DriFan3: wtf?
[00:14] *** dracus sets mode: +b *!*Skank@nic-*-c*-*.mn.mediao
ne.net
[00:14] *** DriFan3 was kicked by dracus (ahh, another troll.)
[00:15] <NoizyToyz> haha
[00:15] <CaraBear> excuse me?
[00:15] <Tailspin> CaraBear Follow this chain of logic, You 
  are connected to the internet, This is as Online as it 
  gets, unless you belong to AOL or something like that, in 
  order to be connected to the internet, you would need a 
  modem, here you are, hence, you must have a modem
[00:15] <dracus> hrm, same address as an earlier one.
[00:15] <NoizyToyz> intersting
[00:15] <Apatrix> Tailspin, master of Logic
[00:16] *** dracus sets mode: +b *!~*@*.mn.mediaone.net
[00:16] <CaraBear> well I know i'm on the Internet, i've told 
  you that....but I need my modem hooked up so I can get 
  online...that's why I came here
[00:16] <Apatrix> As far as we're concerned, we don't see any 
  distinction between "on the internet" and "online"
[00:16] <shuer> if he is the master of logic, how come hes in 
  a tailspin?
[00:17] <Tailspin> shuer luck :)
[00:17] <Apatrix> They're one and the same to us
[00:17] <CaraBear> okay
[00:17] <Tailspin> CaraBear you are either a troll , or are 
  beyond anyones ability to help.

  modems

  computer, is a modem

[00:22] <CaraBear> yeah, well my computer doesn't have a 
  phone line going into it, shouldn't the phone line go into

[00:31] <CaraBear> and it says something like installing? I 
  think it has to do with that external modem again?
[00:31] <prysm-> I think you need to look at your 
  configuration
[00:31] <CaraBear> where's that at?
[00:31] <prysm-> and I  think you need to call your provider 
  in the morning
[00:32] <shuer> the only reason to have a modem is to connect 
  to the net...  if your connected  now, you don't need one
[00:32] <prysm-> to get them to walk  you through it
[00:32] <prysm-> they'd have the numbers you need to put into 
  it
[00:32] <CaraBear> Shuer: I don't think you're fully 
  understanding my problem, Prysm is doing just fine for 
  now...?
[00:32] <shuer> <sigh>
[00:32] <CaraBear> so I should call my ISP in the morning and 
  ask them for numbers?
[00:32] <Roo> shuer: no hope
[00:33] <shuer> why do you want a modem?
[00:33] <CaraBear> Shuer: what?
[00:33] <shuer> why do you want a modem?
[00:33] <CaraBear> so that I can get online and use my ICQ...
[00:33] <Tailspin> shuer , to get ONLINE
[00:33] <shuer> you are online
[00:34] <Etude> I give her credit.  I don't think anyone can 
  be that stupid.  I think she is an excellent troll
[00:34] <Etude> I don't know about prysm.  I HOPE she is 
  trolling the troll
[00:34] <Etude> But I have a feeling she is serious
[00:34] <CaraBear> Etude: I thought you understood this too? 
[00:34] <CaraBear> where did Prysm go to?
[00:34] <shuer> if you cannot connect to ICQ now  its prolly 
  cuz the servers are full
[00:34] <Etude> I feel I do
[Etude:#irchelp PING]
[00:35] <shuer> you cannot be here now if your not connected 
  to the net..
[00:35] <CaraBear> well i'm trying to connect on ICQ but it 
  keeps on saying that I need a connection to the internet
[00:35] <shuer> then it has a bug in it
[00:35] <shuer> go download it again
[00:35] <Etude> then your ICQ is broken.  I never used it 
  myself
[00:36] <CaraBear> and I try to go to the online/avaliable 
  thingie and it totally isn't working
[00:36] <CaraBear> so I need to go online
[00:36] <Roo> you ARE online

  Internet or going Online, I need to hook up this modem

  hooking up my modem?
[00:41] <CaraBear> you guys are waaaaay off track with my

  figment of my imagination.

  loading

[00:45] <Etude> I can't find out if she is a good witch or a 
  bad witch though
[00:45] <Tailspin> i preferd the drugs conversation

  intelligence of the gene pool?
[00:47] * Apatrix smirks and returns to MASH
[00:47] <Tailspin> di, we tried that

[00:47] <Etude> I just wish she would confess
[00:47] <Dianora> that usually works
[00:47] <Dianora> CaraBear, you are a troll.
[00:47] <NoizyToyz> heh
[00:47] <Dianora> now run along

  increase the overall average of the pool   :)
[00:48] <Etude> Confess, troll!
[00:48] <Dianora> You are on the internet, you are online, 
  you either have a phone + modem or you have cablemodem, BUT 
  YOU ARE FUCKING WELL ONLINE YOU TWIT

[00:48] <NoizyToyz> heh
[00:48] <Tailspin> fetch the comfy chair
[00:49] * Etude dunks carabear under water
[00:49] <shuer> gotta admit..  this is one of the best 
  trollers I've ever seen  :)
[00:49] <Dianora> Carabear, do you know what a phone is?
[00:49] <CaraBear> Dianora, I do have a modem, it's an 
  external modem
[00:49] <CaraBear> yes, I know what a phone is?
[00:49] <shuer> I give them a 10
[00:49] <Dianora> Carabear, when you pick up the phone, and 
  you call someone does it work if there is no dial tone?
[00:49] <Dianora> Carabear, you are on the internet, you are 
  online
[00:49] <CaraBear> Dianora, I can pick up the phone and call 
  anyone just like you can?
[00:49] <CaraBear> I know i'm on the Internet
[00:50] <CaraBear> that is NOT the problem
[00:50] <Dianora> your web doesn't work
[00:50] <Dianora> is that the problem?
[00:50] <shuer> could it be the internet programs can't see 
  the cable modem?
[00:50] <Dianora> shuer, yes
[00:50] <CaraBear> the problem is that I need to hook up my 
  modem so I can go Online and use my ICQ
[00:50] <Etude> could be she
[00:50] <Dianora> there is a setting for taht
[00:50] <Etude> could be she's a troll
[00:50] <Dianora> no
[00:50] <Dianora> it could be she thinks she has to call 
  another provider to use icq
[00:51] <Dianora> and she is on a cablemodem now
[00:51] <Dianora> carabear, are you on a cablemodem now?
[00:51] <CaraBear> no Dianora, I have a modem
[00:51] <CaraBear> no
[00:51] <Dianora> then you are on that modem.
[00:51] <CaraBear> i'm trying to hook up my EXTERNAL modem
[00:51] <Dianora> or you wouldn't be talking to us
[00:51] <Etude> go ahead.  Come to your own conclusions.  I 
  already have mine
[00:51] <Dianora> carabear, do you NOT see the contradiction 
  you are putting us through?
[00:51] <CaraBear> how can I be on that modem when it's in 
  the box?
[00:51] <CaraBear> what contradiction?
[00:52] <Dianora> carabear, you are on some modem now
[00:52] <Etude> You can't.  Therefore it is magic.
[00:52] <Dianora> carabear, or you woulnd't be here
[00:52] <Tailspin> you have to be connected to the internet 
  somehow
[00:52] <CaraBear> I am connected to the INTERNET
[00:52] <Dianora> carabear, are you using an internal modem?
[00:52] <shuer> who installed this new computer?
[00:52] <Dianora> how?
[00:52] <Etude> I don't believe anyone believes in magic
[00:52] <Dianora> how are you on the internet?
[00:52] <CaraBear> I said it's an external modem
[00:52] <Dianora> without a modem?
[00:52] <CaraBear> I clicked on my ISP's icon
[00:52] <CaraBear> for the third time
[00:52] * NoizyToyz shakes his head
[00:52] <prysm-> if you want to change your internal modem 
  for an external
[00:53] <CaraBear> no no no
[00:53] <NoizyToyz> can this be over soon
[00:53] <Dianora> carabear, then you have to be on an 
  internal modem.
[00:53] <prysm-> you have to take out the internal modem and 
  put in the other card
[00:53] <CaraBear> I don't have an internal modem
[00:53] <NoizyToyz> GAAAH
[00:53] <Dianora> carabear, THEN how are you on the internet 
  without a modem?
[00:53] <NoizyToyz> EEEENOUGH
[00:53] <shuer> LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[00:53] <prysm-> maybe cable?
[00:53] <Etude> I don't think these people were paying 
  attention earlier
[00:53] <Dianora> carabear, YOU need a modem to be on the 
  internet
[00:53] <Etude> same fucking questions over and over
[00:53] <CaraBear> Etude: Exactly!!!!
[00:53] * NoizyToyz bangs his head repeatedly into a wall
[00:53] <Tailspin> The only reason i havn't kicked is because 
  i wanna see the kill
[00:53] <shuer> I'll be saving this log....  its gonna be a 
  classic  :)
[00:53] * prysm- goes back to taking care of multiple trojan 
  joins
[00:53] <CaraBear> Dianora: as I said before, I 
  double-clicked on my isp's icon
[00:53] <Dianora> Carabear, you need a modem to be on the 
  internet
[00:53] <NoizyToyz> shuer: ay
[00:54] <Dianora> carabear, you cannot be here without a 
  modem working.
[00:54] <NoizyToyz> shuer: im publishing it :)
[00:54] <prysm-> or cable
[00:54] <prysm-> or something
[00:54] <CaraBear> I have a modem Dianora, it's sitting about 
  3 feet away from me
[00:54] <Dianora> carabear, you might have an external modem, 
  but you are not using it now.
[00:54] <Etude> I think carabear should be PROUD of herself
[00:54] <prysm-> or ethernet?
[00:54] <Dianora> is it plugged in carabear?
[00:54] <CaraBear> I know i'm not using it, I want to hook it 
  up!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[00:54] <Etude> She keeps catching people with the same SHIT
[00:54] <prysm-> Etude :)
[00:54] <Dianora> carabear, you dont' need to hook it up. you 
  are already on the internet.
[00:54] <CaraBear> Etude: can you explain it to them please?
[00:54] <prysm-> nonono
[00:54] <Etude> yes
[00:55] * prysm- does not want to know
[00:55] <Tailspin> CaraBear your modem is in a box ? or came 
  in a box ?
[00:55] <CaraBear> I know i'm on the internet, problem is I 
  want to go online
[00:55] <Etude> Carabear is a troll.  Or she is thick as a 
  brick/  Or she has magical powers
[00:55] <Dianora> carabear, you are online.
[00:55] <shuer> LOL!!!!!!!!  like I said...  for as long as 
  I've been on irc..  this is the best troller I've ever seen 
   :)
[00:55] <CaraBear> it came in a box, I tried hooking it up, 
  couldn't, put it back in the box and came here for help
[00:55] <prysm-> she wants to use her web browser
[00:55] <prysm-> and get email set up
[00:55] <Dianora> carabear, you havea nother computer?
[00:55] <Tailspin> CaraBear What does the box say its name is 
  ?
[00:55] <prysm-> and use ICQ
[00:55] <NoizyToyz> shuer: yep
[00:55] <prysm-> that is what she wants to do
[00:55] <Dianora> carabear, because you don't need that modem.
[00:55] <Dianora> for that computer.
[00:56] <Tailspin> prysm- I think not, anything that would 
  prevent those from working, would be blocking ident.
[00:56] <shuer> pryz  she says every time she starts the 
  browser..  it asks if she wants to go online  :)
[00:56] <CaraBear> it's a brand new computer, I bought it 8 
  hours ago, it came with an external modem
[00:56] <prysm-> I saw that
[00:56] <Dianora> carabear, uh is that the computer you are 
  using now?
[00:56] <Etude> yes
[00:56] <CaraBear> right on shuer
[00:56] <CaraBear> yes, i'm using my new computer right now
[00:56] <NoizyToyz> ok
[00:56] <NoizyToyz> ive had enough of this
[00:56] <prysm-> I think that is the problem
[00:57] <Dianora> carabear, then your system is misconfigured
[00:57] <NoizyToyz> this is mindless drivvle
[00:57] <prysm-> it needs to be configured with the help of 
  her provider
[00:57] <Apatrix> This log ought to be carved in stone and 
  displayed at the channel gates.
[00:57] <Dianora> carabear, because youa re talking to us 
  now, and you do not need that modem
[00:57] <prysm-> my son had this problem
[00:57] <NoizyToyz> someone end shit now

[01:02] <shuer> no  I wanna know how a browser can NOT see 
  that shes online..

[01:02] <CaraBear> ya?
[01:02] <Dianora> Carabear, you shoudl put the computer back 
  into the box
[01:02] <CaraBear> no no
[01:02] <Apatrix> She's already been told that at least once. 
  :)
[01:02] <Dianora> Carabear, take it back to the store you 
  bought it from
[01:02] <CaraBear> someone already told me that idea
[01:02] <Dianora> Carabear, and tell them you are too stupid 
  to own a computer.
[01:02] <Etude> trolling for dollars
[01:02] * Dianora goes back to coding
[01:02] <NoizyToyz> GAAH
[01:02] <Etude> good'
[01:02] <shuer> I aklready told her that  :)
[01:03] * Etude agrees
[01:03] <Dianora> someone
[01:03] <Dianora> please
[01:03] <CaraBear> okay, I need a real tech channel now, you 
  guys understand this but just won't help me
[01:03] <Dianora> kick her the hell off
[01:03] <Apatrix> This night will live on in infamy. *grin*
[01:03] <Tailspin> CaraBear Ok , to make Dianora and prysm- 
  happy, can you go to Start menu, Settings, Control panel, 
  Internet, Connections, Proxy Settings (or just proxy 
  section), and tell is what it says ?
[01:03] <NoizyToyz> DISPOSE OF THIS NIGHTMARE!!
[01:03] <NoizyToyz> MAKE IT STOP! MAKE IT STOP!
[01:03] <Tailspin> is/us
[01:03] <Etude> NO!  I want her to confess!
[01:03] <Dianora> oh ya, if she had a proxy
[01:03] <shuer> how can it be that a browser does not see 
  that the puter is online??
[01:04] <Tailspin> Dianora if there was a proxy set, icq 
  would still work
[01:04] <Dianora> tailspin, maybe not if she has just changed 
  providers
[01:04] <NoizyToyz> no! wont this ever ENNnnNND!?
[01:04] <Tailspin> if there is no proxy set, it would all work
[01:04] <prysm-> CaraBear plese do what tailspin suggested
[01:04] <CaraBear> hold up
[01:04] <NoizyToyz> and go away!
[01:04] <Etude> Please do what I suggest.  CONFESS!
[01:04] <CaraBear> okay...
[01:04] <CaraBear> i'm trying this proxy thing
[01:04] <NoizyToyz> shooo!
[01:05] <CaraBear> go under Internet Options?
[01:05] * prysm- recommends the ever unpopular /ignore 
  command to NoizyToyz
[01:05] <NoizyToyz> prysm-: thats fair enough
[01:05] <Tailspin> yes
[01:05] <NoizyToyz> prysm-: i forgot aobout that :)
[01:05] <shuer> ok  I can see if ti has a proxy set...  but 
  there is not proxy setting for ICQ that I know of  but let 
  me check
[01:05] <NoizyToyz> prysm-: i was too busy getting annoyed
[01:05] <CaraBear> Tailsping: go under internet options, then 
  connection and then what?
[01:05] <Tailspin> shuer There is a place for them, but a new 
  machine, 8 hours old, wouldn't have any set
[01:06] <CaraBear> there isn't anything there about proxy's
[01:06] <Tailspin> click LAN settings
[01:06] <Etude> Amazingly enough.  Carabear does not annoy 
  me.  It is everybody else who annoys me :)
[01:06] * Apatrix is absolutely fascinated
[01:07] <CaraBear> okay, there's an open box with 'use a 
  proxy server' but it's unchecked?
[01:07] <shuer> well  a new machine yould not come with ICQ  
  or mirc
[01:07] <shuer> would not
[01:07] <shuer> so it had to be downloaded
[01:08] <Tailspin> shuer sure off the internet
[01:08] <Tailspin> but not ONLINE
[01:08] <shuer> and the mirc is 5.6
[01:08] <CaraBear> shuer: I already installed ICQ from a cd
[01:08] <shuer> old
[01:08] <dracus> ARGH - food.com is down...
[01:08] <Etude> Cara, can you use your powers for good and 
  not evil?  You see the thing is
[01:08] <CaraBear> Tailspin: anything else with that Proxy 
  server thingie?
[01:09] <Etude> I am currently out of work and almost out of 
  money ...
[01:09] <Tailspin> Nope
[01:09] <CaraBear> hrrmmm
[01:09] <prysm-> there you go
[01:09] <Etude> Is there anyway that you can do your magic 
  and make me a multi-millionaire?
[01:09] <prysm-> if you marry him and support him
[01:09] <Etude> Pretty please with sugar on the pot?
[01:09] <prysm-> he will configure your comptuer for you
[01:09] <shuer> tail  where in ICQ do you see a setting for a 
  proxy?

[01:13] <CaraBear> alright, you guys really aren't any 
  helpful, next time if you can't help someone with their 
  problem please don't ban them because of their problem?
[01:13] <Tailspin> CaraBear we'll make a note
[01:13] <shuer> bit that would have to be set manually....  
  it would not be that way by default
[01:13] <prysm->  we told you before you started that this is 
  not a tech help channel
[01:13] <Etude> no confession.  I figured as much :(
[01:13] <CaraBear> i'll try back tomorrow if my ISP can't 
  seem to fix this...all of you have a nice night and thanks 
  for helping me whichever of you really did try
[01:13] <prysm-> and to work with the people who supply your 
  connection
