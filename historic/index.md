# The Archives

This is where we're stashing older documents which are no longer of any use
beyond historical curiosity.

## Defunct and Abandoned IRC Clients
* [wsirc](/historic/wsirc.html) - Ancient 16bit IRC client dating back to the Windows 3.1 days.

## Other documents
* [IRC by telnet](/irchelp.historic/telnet.html) - Old guide from 1995 for accessing EFNet through public shell providers.
